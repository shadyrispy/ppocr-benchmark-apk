# Full OCR profiling

The private `full-ocr-profile-driver` measures the exact bundled
DET/CLS/REC composition without changing the public C ABI. It exists to select
CPU optimization work from evidence rather than from isolated REC results.

The profiler is built when `BUILD_TESTING=ON`. A Ninja Release invocation is:

```powershell
.\build-ninja-c\full-ocr-profile-driver.exe `
  .\build-ninja-c\models\det.lwm `
  .\build-ninja-c\models\cls.lwm `
  .\build-ninja-c\models\rec.lwm `
  .\models\ppocrv6-tiny\ppocr_keys.txt `
  .\build-ninja-c\models\sample.ppm `
  5 `
  4
```

The last two arguments are measured iterations and OCR line workers. Run one
ordinary warm-up before the measured iterations so dynamic DET session sizing,
crop storage, and reusable workspaces do not distort the report.

## Measurement semantics

The JSON report separates latency from accumulated worker work:

- `wall_nanoseconds.total` is observed full-request latency;
- DET preprocess, graph, and postprocess are mutually sequential wall stages;
- `crop` measures perspective pixel extraction;
- `line_workers` is the wall time spent processing the CLS/REC line queue;
- `line_worker_critical` is the longest accumulated worker time in that queue;
- `line_dispatch_overhead` is `line_workers - line_worker_critical`, an estimate
  of thread creation, scheduling, joining, and caller-side dispatch overhead;
- `line_work_nanoseconds` sums CLS/REC work across workers and can exceed wall
  time when workers overlap;
- operator and Conv-class time is accumulated work time, not request wall time.

Profiling calls the clock around every graph node. Use it to rank hotspots, not
as the release latency benchmark. `lw-ocr-benchmark` remains the source for
mean/P95 latency, throughput, deterministic output, and RSS measurements.

The operator table covers all current IDs 1 through 21, including the six DET
and CLS operators that the older REC-only profile did not need. Conv work is
also classified as 1x1, ordinary 3x3, Depthwise 3x3, ordinary stride-2 3x3, or
other Conv.

## Implementation-path diagnostics

The implementation_paths section is an internal, additive diagnostic section.
Its counters are separated into detector, classifier, and recognizer, so a
profile can distinguish packed kernels from the unpacked/parallel generic
route:

- packed_conv1x1 and packed_conv3x3_stride2 count prepared-weight Conv paths;
- unpacked_conv and unpacked_matmul count Conv/MatMul calls that did not use
  those prepared layouts (they may still use a parallel generic kernel);
- packed_matmul includes the REC terminal CTC projection fast path;
- ctc_packed_projection versus ctc_generic_projection identifies the terminal
  REC projection implementation;
- fused_gelu counts the AVX2 GELU chain fusion.

The rec_session_cache object contains hits, misses, and reconfigurations for
the adaptive REC Session lookup. A cache hit means the requested adaptive REC
width already has either the active or the retained secondary Session. A miss
causes a concrete-width Session rebuild. These counters are intended to select
the next A/B optimization; they are not part of the public C ABI.

tools/collect_native_ocr_profile.py preserves these counters in each case of
the architecture profile summary and normalizes them per measured request.

## Native ARM64 performance matrix

The native ARM64 workflow runs the same profile and benchmark drivers on the
GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-22.04-arm` runner. Its default `full` case set covers
all combinations of line workers `1/2/4` and DET intra-op threads `1/2/4`.
Use the workflow's `compact` choice only for a quick smoke run (`1:1`, `4:1`,
`1:4`, `4:4`); release-facing comparisons should use `full`.

Each row is reported as `line_workers:det_threads`. The report records the
requested and actual DET thread counts, standalone detector time, full OCR
mean/P95, peak RSS, line count, and the complete text checksum. `Standalone
DET` is a separate detector-only benchmark; it is useful for context but is
not subtracted from full OCR to claim an exact internal stage duration. The
actual stage breakdown comes from the profile driver's sequential DET, crop,
line-worker, and output timings.

The DET profile also records `det_conv_transpose_thread_histogram`. In the
serialized report, index zero counts serial ConvTranspose calls (one worker)
and indices one through fifteen count calls using two through sixteen
intra-op workers. The histogram is a correctness and scheduling diagnostic;
it does not change the public C ABI or LWM format.

All ARM64 changes must retain the full-OCR text checksum and pass the scalar
reference comparison. NEON ConvTranspose range execution is only selected for
the validated 2x2, stride-2, group-1, zero-padding shape; all other shapes
continue through the canonical scalar fallback.

## First Windows x64 result

On the local AVX2 development host, five profiled runs of the bundled 500x500
image produced 16 text lines:

| Stage | 1 worker | 4 workers |
|---|---:|---:|
| Full OCR wall | 856.530 ms | 629.267 ms |
| DET graph | 499.568 ms | 504.278 ms |
| DET preprocess + postprocess | 5.448 ms | 5.422 ms |
| Crop | 4.857 ms | 4.945 ms |
| CLS/REC worker wall | 346.615 ms | 114.591 ms |
| Worker dispatch overhead | 0.011 ms | 0.914 ms |

For the single-worker run, the largest accumulated graph operators were:

| Operator | Time | Graph work |
|---|---:|---:|
| Conv | 503.758 ms | 60.56% |
| ConvTranspose | 106.270 ms | 12.78% |
| Erf | 81.781 ms | 9.83% |
| Resize | 33.603 ms | 4.04% |
| MatMul | 30.809 ms | 3.70% |

These are instrumented profiles rather than uninstrumented A/B claims. The
important decision is nevertheless clear: on this sample, persistent line
worker creation accounts for less than one millisecond, while the single DET
graph takes about 500 milliseconds. A persistent pool remains desirable for
architecture and tail stability, but it is not the next largest latency win.

The report now includes every DET Conv/ConvTranspose node with its exact input,
weight, output, kernel, stride, dilation, padding, group, calls, and time. The
first node-level run identified four missing fast paths rather than a general
threading problem:

- ordinary 3x3 stride-1/pad-1 Conv;
- 2x2 stride-1 Conv with bottom/right padding;
- 2x2 stride-2 ConvTranspose without overlap;
- Depthwise 5x5 stride-1/pad-2 Conv.

SSE2 and AVX2 kernels were added for the three Conv families. The
non-overlapping ConvTranspose path was reordered by output channel so it writes
contiguous planes and retains the original per-output accumulation order.

## Specialized-kernel A/B

The following numbers are uninstrumented Release measurements from the same
AVX2 host, model files, 500x500 image, two warm-ups, eight measured iterations,
and deterministic 16-line result. The baseline executable and DLL were kept in
a separate build directory before changing the kernels.

| Metric | Baseline | Specialized kernels | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Standalone DET mean | 494.960 ms | 168.194 ms | -66.0% |
| Full OCR mean, 1 worker | 845.416 ms | 484.385 ms | -42.7% |
| Full OCR mean, 4 workers | 618.641 ms | 256.651 ms | -58.5% |
| Full OCR throughput, 4 workers | 1.616/s | 3.896/s | 2.41x |
| Post-DET work, 4 workers | 114.312 ms | 91.054 ms | -20.3% |

The largest individual changes in the instrumented node report were:

| DET node/path | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| node 234, regular 3x3 stride-1 | 140.54 ms | 13.38 ms |
| node 236, ConvTranspose 2x2 stride-2 | 82.94 ms | 4.89 ms |
| node 2, Conv 2x2 stride-1 | 41.21 ms | 2.84 ms |
| node 4, Conv 2x2 stride-1 | 39.60 ms | 2.64 ms |
| node 221, Depthwise 5x5 | 19.80 ms | 2.50 ms |

These results favor shape-specific SIMD and cache-friendly loop order before
operator-level threading. The next experiment should examine the remaining
stride-2 3x3 nodes and then compare output-channel parallelism at 1/2/4/8
threads. Nested operator threads must stay disabled while CLS/REC line workers
are active unless an oversubscription benchmark proves a benefit.

The automated `full_ocr_operator_profile` test runs both one and four workers,
requires deterministic 16-line output, verifies all 21 operator IDs, checks the
exact 4,946 node invocations per request, and confirms that Conv-class counts
sum to the Conv operator count. It also verifies the DET node metadata and
requires every Conv/ConvTranspose invocation to have a concrete 4D shape.

## Session-prepared pointwise weights

The next 1x1 experiment keeps the public NCHW tensors and canonical LWM OIHW
weights unchanged. During session creation, eligible group-1 weights are
copied once into `[Cout/4][Cin][4]` blocks. The execution microkernel loads one
input vector and updates four output-channel accumulators, reducing repeated
input traffic without changing each output element's input-channel addition
order. Scalar, SSE2, AVX2, NEON, and LSX implementations share the packed
format; FMA remains disabled.

The selector requires an optimized packed backend, an output channel count
divisible by four, and either the long feature-map geometry used by CLS/REC or
a square map with at least 256 spatial values. The latter remains AVX2-only on
x86, while NEON and LSX also use it on ARM64 and LoongArch64. Scalar-only
targets do not allocate packed weights. The cross-architecture extension keeps
the private packed format and arithmetic order, but its latency and memory
tradeoff must be measured separately on native ARM64 and Loongson hardware.

The checked analysis behind this decision can be reproduced with:

```powershell
python converter/analyze_conv_shapes.py
```

It reports every Conv/MatMul/Gemm node, its concrete shape and FLOP share, plus
deduplicated kernel families for the bundled REC, CLS, and DET models.

One paired local Windows x64 Release run used the preserved pre-change binary,
the same DLL build settings, bundled 500x500/16-line fixture, three warm-ups,
and twelve measured calls:

| Metric | Existing kernel | Prepared 4-output kernel | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Full OCR, 1 worker | 598.517 ms | 562.491 ms | -6.02% |
| Post-DET, 1 worker | 389.860 ms | 355.069 ms | -8.92% |
| Throughput, 1 worker | 1.671/s | 1.778/s | +6.41% |
| Steady RSS, 1 worker | 67.61 MiB | 69.68 MiB | +2.07 MiB |
| Full OCR, 4 workers | 361.050 ms | 338.231 ms | -6.32% |
| Post-DET, 4 workers | 155.578 ms | 132.231 ms | -15.01% |
| Throughput, 4 workers | 2.770/s | 2.957/s | +6.75% |
| Steady RSS, 4 workers | 98.14 MiB | 106.38 MiB | +8.25 MiB |

The extra memory is per-session packed weight storage, so it scales with the
number of CLS/REC workers. This tradeoff should be remeasured on each target
CPU and worker count. Direct tail-block tests require the available scalar and
architecture-specific implementation plus automatic dispatch to be
byte-identical before ONNX reference comparison. The x64 figures above remain
x64-only and are not ARM64 or LoongArch performance claims.

## Integer nearest-neighbor Resize

The DET feature pyramid contains six nearest-neighbor Resize nodes per graph
execution. The original general-rank kernel decoded every output element back
to all source coordinates with repeated modulo, division, and `floor` calls.
For the model's exact NCHW integer upscales, that coordinate work dominated the
actual copies.

The specialized path requires rank 4, unchanged N/C dimensions, scale 1 on N/C,
and exact positive integer height/width factors consistent with the resolved
output shape. It expands one source row contiguously, then copies that completed
row for the remaining vertical repetitions. Fractional scales, downsampling,
and all other ranks still use the original path. No lookup table, persistent
allocation, model-format change, or public API change is introduced.

On the local three-iteration operator profile, Resize fell from 99.240 ms to
1.775 ms (-98.21%), and the instrumented DET graph fell from 495.248 ms to
389.256 ms (-21.40%). A follow-up uninstrumented 3+12 run measured:

| Metric | Prepared-pointwise stage | Integer Resize stage | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DET, 1 worker | 207.421 ms | 135.541 ms | -34.65% |
| Full OCR, 1 worker | 562.491 ms | 436.159 ms | -22.46% |
| DET, 4 workers | 206.000 ms | 139.311 ms | -32.37% |
| Full OCR, 4 workers | 338.231 ms | 224.049 ms | -33.76% |
| Throughput, 4 workers | 2.957/s | 4.463/s | +50.94% |

These are sequential local stage measurements, not a portable capacity claim.
Steady RSS remained at the prepared-pointwise stage level. The tensor reference
suite covers different height/width integer factors across multiple batches and
channels, plus a fractional-scale case that must remain on the general path.

## Exact spatial reduction and pooling

The next exact optimization targets two remaining coordinate-heavy operators
without changing their public or model contracts:

- NCHW ReduceMean over spatial axes 2 and 3 now sums each contiguous channel
  plane directly. Its input traversal and floating-point addition order remain
  row-major and identical to the general implementation.
- The detector's exact 2x2, stride-1, bottom/right-padded SAME_UPPER MaxPool
  uses direct row pointers for the interior and separate right/bottom border
  loops. Comparison order remains row-major, including the existing NaN
  behavior.

All other ReduceMean axes, keep-dimension modes, kernels, strides, padding and
ceil modes retain the original general paths. Neither specialization allocates
memory or adds session state.

On the local Windows x64 Release operator profiler, using the bundled 500x500
fixture, the targeted work per full OCR request changed as follows:

| Operator | General path | Exact specialized path | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| MaxPool | 12.115 ms | 0.651 ms | -94.62% |
| ReduceMean | 16.736 ms | 3.819 ms | -77.18% |

An uninstrumented 3-warm-up/12-measurement observation after both changes
reported 230.426 ms full-OCR mean and 4.340 requests/s with four line workers.
Machine load produced visible run-to-run latency noise, so that observation is
recorded as a local result rather than a paired end-to-end improvement claim.
The tensor reference suite covers multi-batch/multi-channel spatial reduction,
the specialized pool interior and borders, and the pre-existing general paths.

## Contiguous-axis Softmax

The recognition output Softmax processes 6,906 classes on a contiguous final
axis. A direct-row path removes the general inner-stride multiplication and
offset reconstruction, but deliberately retains `expf`, maximum selection,
summation order and element-wise division. It supports separate and in-place
output buffers; Softmax over a genuinely strided axis remains on the general
path.

In one five-iteration Windows x64 Release operator profile, Softmax work per
full OCR request fell from 15.848 ms to 13.967 ms (-11.87%). The scalar
reference suite covers both contiguous and strided axes and verifies that the
contiguous in-place result is byte-identical to separate-output execution.

A four-output-row MatMul experiment was also measured and rejected. Although
it loaded each wide weight vector once for four output rows, the four concurrent
6,906-column output streams expanded the active output working set. MatMul rose
from 32.105 ms to 33.735 ms per request (+5.08%) on the same class of profile,
so the experiment was removed rather than retained behind a heuristic.

Two exactness-gated Erf/GELU experiments were also rejected. An Abramowitz and
Stegun single-precision Erf approximation stayed within the numerical and OCR
reference gates, but its `expf` and division work raised median Erf time from
80.94 ms to 125.40 ms (+54.9%) on MSVC/UCRT. An exact five-node
`Div -> Erf -> Add -> Mul -> Mul` fusion retained `erff` and the original
floating-point operation order, but paired 3+12 full-OCR measurements showed no
repeatable gain: 412.13 ms became 413.18 ms with one worker, and 216.08 ms
became 216.18 ms with four workers. Both implementations were removed. Future
Erf work therefore needs a genuinely vectorized approximation plus an explicit
error corpus; eliminating intermediate tensor passes alone is not sufficient.

## Four-output stride-2 3x3 Conv

The next AVX2 experiment targets the stride-2 3x3 Conv family used by DET, CLS
and REC. The previous kernel streamed one output channel at a time, so every
output plane repeated the same strided input loads and even-lane shuffles. The
new path keeps four independent output vectors in registers and applies four
output-channel weights to each gathered input vector. Every output still adds
input channels and the nine kernel positions in the original order, and FMA
remains disabled, so the result is byte-identical to the scalar reference.

The selector requires an output-channel count divisible by four. Other shapes
retain the previous output-plane streaming kernel; a small-input-channel path
also covers non-multiple-of-four outputs. No packed weights, session memory,
public ABI or LWM model change is introduced.

An alternating local A/B used independent Release builds from commit `7fb8881`
and the candidate source, the same bundled 500x500/16-line fixture, three
profiled iterations and one line worker. Across four operator-profile runs, the
accumulated stride-2 3x3 work per request changed as follows:

| Component | Existing AVX2 path | Four-output path | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| All DET/CLS/REC stride-2 3x3 | 57.98 ms | 35.40 ms | -38.9% |
| DET | 27.61 ms | 19.71 ms | -28.6% |
| CLS | 1.93 ms | 0.85 ms | -56.0% |
| REC | 28.44 ms | 14.85 ms | -47.8% |

The first DET layer (`Cin=3`, `Cout=16`) fell from about 6.08 ms to 1.75 ms in
the alternating measurements. The direct Conv reference driver includes odd
spatial dimensions and a four-output-channel case, and requires the AVX2 result
to be byte-identical to the scalar kernel before graph and OCR gates run.

The public reusable-handle benchmark was also run in alternating order for the
complete OCR latency. Each entry below is the mean of three independent
processes; every process used three warm-up calls followed by eight measured
calls on the same 500x500/16-line fixture.

| Line workers | Existing AVX2 path | Four-output path | Latency change | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 401.195 ms | 382.943 ms | -4.55% | 1.048x |
| 4 | 212.031 ms | 203.781 ms | -3.89% | 1.040x |

Throughput increased by 4.77% with one worker and 4.03% with four workers. The
end-to-end gain is smaller than the targeted operator reduction because image
pre/post-processing and the other graph operators are unchanged.

## Shape-aware x64 pointwise microkernel

The next pointwise experiment retains the existing four-output packed-weight
format but doubles the x64 AVX2 spatial tile from 8 to 16 values. Eight output
accumulators remain live while each packed weight broadcast is shared by two
input vectors. The wider tile is x64-only because 32-bit x86 exposes too few
vector registers and would spill; x86, SSE2, non-x86, and spatial tails retain
their existing kernels.

The session selector continues to prepare long CLS/REC feature maps. On an x64
AVX2 host it now also prepares square pointwise maps with at least 256 spatial
positions, covering the useful DET maps while excluding tiny attention
tensors. The canonical LWM weights remain unchanged. Prepared weights are
private session state, every output retains its original input-channel
addition order, FMA remains disabled, and the public ABI is unchanged.

Four alternating three-iteration operator profiles compared the independent
Release binary from commit `fcbb37e` with the final candidate:

| Profiled work per request | Existing 4x8 path | Shape-aware 4x16 path | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| All 1x1 Conv | 112.244 ms | 84.396 ms | -24.81% |
| DET 1x1 Conv | 30.370 ms | 22.156 ms | -27.05% |
| Instrumented full OCR wall | 399.979 ms | 381.103 ms | -4.72% |

The uninstrumented reusable-handle benchmark used the same 500x500/16-line
fixture. Two alternating one-worker pairs, each with five warm-ups and twenty
measured calls, changed full OCR from 389.570 ms to 359.945 ms (-7.60%, 1.082x)
and throughput by +8.22%. Five alternating four-worker pairs, each with three
warm-ups and twelve measured calls, averaged 213.683 ms versus 199.140 ms
(-6.80%); the paired reduction median was 5.92%, with a 1.67% to 15.31% range
under visible host-load variation.

Preparing the additional DET weights raised steady RSS by about 2.8 MiB per OCR
handle. This is one detector-side cost and does not multiply with the number of
line workers. The complete Windows x64 suite passed 33/33 tests, while the x86
ABI, export, Conv, DET graph, full-OCR, and staged-package gates passed 6/6 and
continued to use the previous 4x8 path.

## Piecewise AVX2 Erf

The successful follow-up to the rejected scalar Erf experiments uses three
piecewise degree-8 single-precision polynomials. They cover `|x| < 1`,
`1 <= |x| < 2`, and `2 <= |x| < 4`; larger finite magnitudes saturate to one,
then the input sign bit is restored. The implementation evaluates eight values
at a time without FMA, preserves positive and negative zero, maps infinities to
positive and negative one, and propagates NaNs. A scalar `erff` tail handles
non-multiples of eight. The offline Emscripten build evaluates the same regions
four values at a time with WASM SIMD128; other non-AVX2 targets continue to
execute the existing scalar kernel.

The direct kernel gate samples 4,099 evenly spaced values from -6 through 6,
requires maximum absolute error no greater than `5e-7`, checks monotonicity and
checks the special-value contract. REC, CLS and DET graph references, the full
OCR pipeline reference, and the ten-crop OCR Golden corpus remain mandatory.
SIMD capability is detected once per graph execution so the runtime does not
repeat CPUID/XGETBV for every Erf node. No public ABI, LWM model, or caller-owned
buffer contract changes.

Four alternating three-iteration operator profiles compared the frozen
shape-aware pointwise binary with this candidate on the bundled
500x500/16-line fixture:

| Profiled work per request | Scalar `erff` | Piecewise AVX2 | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| All Erf | 86.599 ms | 15.248 ms | -82.39% |
| DET Erf | 20.586 ms | 3.626 ms | -82.39% |
| REC Erf | 66.013 ms | 11.622 ms | -82.39% |
| Instrumented full OCR wall | 390.733 ms | 307.389 ms | -21.33% |

The uninstrumented reusable-handle benchmark then used five alternating pairs.
One worker used five warm-ups and twenty measured calls per process; four
workers used three warm-ups and twelve measured calls. Because this host showed
visible run-to-run load variation, the paired median and full range are
reported instead of selecting the fastest run:

| Line workers | Paired latency reduction median | Pair range | Throughput gain at median pair |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 19.61% | 3.73% to 39.95% | 24.40% |
| 4 | 16.50% | 3.65% to 18.56% | 19.76% |

Steady RSS was effectively unchanged. The complete Windows x64 suite passed
33/33 tests and the complete x86 suite passed 32/32 tests, including numerical,
graph, full-OCR, Golden-corpus, ABI/export and staged-package coverage.

## REC resized-width distribution

The private full-OCR profile now records the actual aspect-ratio-preserving REC
width before right padding. Its JSON report includes the sample count, resized
and target width sums, mean resized width, mean padding ratio, and stable
192/256/320/480/640/800/960/overflow histogram buckets. The profile driver
accepts an optional final `rec-target-width` argument and reports it as
`rec_target_width`, so a 960 run no longer loses every width above 320 to
clamping. Worker-local counters are merged after joining; the public C ABI is
unchanged.

With adaptive REC enabled and `target_width = 960` as the maximum, repeated
requests produced these per-image distributions:

| Width range | Bundled 500x500 sample (16 lines) | Article screenshot (8 lines) |
|---|---:|---:|
| <= 192 | 0 | 2 |
| 193 to 256 | 3 | 0 |
| 257 to 320 | 2 | 0 |
| 321 to 480 | 2 | 0 |
| 481 to 640 | 6 | 0 |
| 641 to 800 | 2 | 1 |
| 801 to 960 | 1 | 5 |
| Mean resized width | 491.5 | 729.0 |
| Mean right-padding ratio | 15.26% | 5.08% |

For the implemented 192/320/480/640/960 policy, the bundled sample falls from
15,360 fixed-width units to 9,280 (-39.6%), while the long-line-heavy article
falls from 7,680 to 6,144 (-20.0%). The 960 bucket remains necessary for five
of the article's eight detected lines, so simply lowering the global width
would lose long-line capacity.

The initial adaptive implementation treated a configured width above 320 as
the maximum, selected the
smallest 192/320/480/640/maximum bucket that fits each crop, and sorted crop
indices by selected width before filling worker batches. Results were still
written to their original line slots, preserving reading order. The initial
scheduler limited actual crop pixels to one worker batch. The width-aware
dynamic scheduler described below later replaced that batch barrier and retains
all crops for the duration of one request.

Each recognizer keeps its active session plus one previous concrete width. A
cache hit swaps the two slots; a miss discards only the inactive slot and builds
the candidate transactionally, leaving the active session usable on failure.
This avoids five persistent sessions per worker while covering common
short/long two-width pages. Standalone recognition remains fixed-width, and no
public C ABI or LWM model change is introduced.

Three alternating eight-request Windows x64 Release profiles compared the same
candidate with adaptive selection disabled or enabled:

| Input | Workers | Fixed 960 | Adaptive 960 max | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bundled sample | 1 | 579.86 ms | 399.58 ms | -31.09% |
| Bundled sample | 4 | 208.96 ms | 172.62 ms | -17.39% |
| Article screenshot | 1 | 334.00 ms | 289.31 ms | -13.38% |
| Article screenshot | 4 | 146.28 ms | 138.07 ms | -5.61% |

Every pair retained checksum `0ebf8b448ab7df47` for the bundled sample and
`d4a3997f630e5719` for the article. A separate process working-set observation
on the four-worker bundled run measured about 108.0 MiB peak for fixed 960 and
136.3 MiB for adaptive width. The roughly 28.3 MiB increase is the bounded
second-session cache; it is an explicit latency/memory tradeoff and should be
remeasured on other models and architectures.

## Fixed-pool DET output-channel parallelism

The first fixed-pool implementation used the full-OCR worker budget to size a
session-owned DET thread pool. The current CPU-budget-aware policy described
below supersedes that coupling and sizes DET independently.
Eligible group-1 and depthwise convolutions split disjoint output-channel
ranges only when their estimated multiply-add count reaches eight million.
Packed 1x1 slices remain aligned to four output channels. Threads are created
once with the dynamic DET session and reused across graph nodes; small kernels
remain serial. DET and CLS/REC execute in separate phases, so operator workers
are never nested inside line workers. Standalone detector and session APIs keep
their previous single-thread behavior, and the public C ABI is unchanged.

On the local Windows x64 Release AVX2 build, the bundled 500x500/16-line fixture
was warmed up and then measured in seven independent processes with five OCR
requests per process. Median per-request results were:

| Metric | 1 worker | 4 workers | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Complete OCR | 291.35 ms | 121.20 ms | -58.40% |
| DET graph | 90.66 ms | 49.15 ms | -45.78% |
| CLS/REC line phase | 190.84 ms | 61.36 ms | -67.85% |

Compared with the immediately preceding four-worker build, whose repeated
profile was about 175 ms per request, the combined fixed-pool DET change brings
the complete pipeline to about 121 ms on this machine. The profile regression
also compares a deterministic text checksum between one- and four-worker runs.

The uninstrumented reusable-handle benchmark used five independent processes,
each with three warm-ups and twenty measured calls. Its median process means
represent the user-visible full OCR latency without per-node profile clocks:

| Workers | Mean OCR | P95 OCR | Throughput | Steady RSS |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 295.14 ms | 298.13 ms | 3.39/s | 72.46 MiB |
| 4 | 122.46 ms | 130.17 ms | 8.17/s | 109.22 MiB |

Four workers therefore reduced complete OCR latency by 58.51%, delivered a
2.41x speedup, and increased throughput by about 141%. The additional memory is
primarily the existing independent CLS/REC worker sessions; the DET pool shares
the detector model, weights, workspace, input, and output buffers.

## Known-capacity CTC and AVX2 GELU fusion

Full OCR allocates each line's text slot from
`lw_recognizer_info.max_text_capacity`. The recognizer now uses that guarantee
to collapse greedy CTC output once, writing UTF-8 text while computing the exact
used capacity and score. Public size queries and calls with smaller buffers
retain the original exact-capacity two-pass path. On the 16-line fixture, the
accumulated CTC work fell from about 7.45 ms to 3.71 ms, but four-worker wall
latency improved by only about 0.38 ms in the initial comparison. This is a
small, low-risk cleanup rather than the main route to the 100 ms target.

A more aggressive REC terminal-head prototype tiled
`MatMul -> Softmax -> CTC` and avoided the full probability tensor. Six
alternating 20-request pairs found only about 0.6 ms median wall improvement:
the Softmax denominator still requires all 6,906 exponentials. The prototype
was removed rather than retaining a second graph executor for that result.

The retained superkernel instead targets the ten REC and three DET GELU chains:

```text
x / sqrt(2) -> Erf -> +1 -> *x -> *0.5
```

Fusion is enabled only on AVX2 when five consecutive nodes have the exact
`sqrt(2)`, `1`, and `0.5` constants, identical FP32 tensor sizes, and four
intermediate tensors whose final consumers are inside the chain. Every other
model and backend continues through the ordinary node dispatcher. The kernel
uses the existing three-region AVX2 Erf polynomial and preserves division,
addition, and multiplication order. A dense 4,099-value test requires fused,
unfused, separate-output, and in-place results to be byte-identical. Graph,
pipeline, Golden-corpus, ABI, HTTP, and staged-package tests remain mandatory.

Six alternating 20-request four-worker pairs used the same Release configuration,
model files, and 500x500/16-line fixture. The baseline included known-capacity
CTC but not GELU fusion:

| Metric | Baseline median | GELU median | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Complete OCR | 110.29 ms | 105.77 ms | -4.10% |
| DET graph | 43.25 ms | 41.10 ms | -4.98% |
| CLS/REC line wall | 55.76 ms | 53.55 ms | -3.96% |
| Accumulated REC graph work | 155.84 ms | 150.59 ms | -3.37% |

Every pair retained output checksum `f7bf2108d8c44764`; paired complete-OCR
improvement ranged from 2.01 ms to 5.57 ms, with a 4.76 ms median. The complete
Windows x64 Release suite passed 34/34 tests. In execution profiles, fused work
is attributed to Erf because the stable public profile schema has no GELU
operator; the four skipped semantic nodes retain invocation markers.

## AVX2 regular 3x3 four-output blocking

The detector's node 234 is a group-1 `64 -> 16` convolution with a 3x3 kernel,
unit stride, pad one, and a 128x128 output. The former AVX2 implementation
completed one output plane at a time, so it loaded the same input vectors once
for every output channel. The new path keeps four independent accumulators and
reuses each input vector across four output planes. It applies to any validated
unit-stride 3x3 shape whose output-channel count is divisible by four; other
shapes retain the previous kernel. A dedicated reference case covers vector
interior pixels, scalar borders, bias, and byte-identical output.

Four alternating pairs of 50-request, four-worker profiles were run under the
same Release configuration. The longer run intentionally reports medians
because the host was under higher sustained load than the earlier GELU test:

| Metric | Previous kernel | Four-output kernel | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Node 234 per invocation | 5.13 ms | 2.95 ms | -42.45% |
| DET graph per request | 48.07 ms | 45.64 ms | -5.06% |
| Complete OCR per request | 139.09 ms | 136.61 ms | -1.78% |

The paired complete-OCR saving had a 2.15 ms median. A separate four-pair,
12-request one-worker profile reduced node 234 from 14.00 ms to 7.48 ms and
complete OCR from 291.24 ms to 286.10 ms. All baseline and candidate runs kept
checksum `f7bf2108d8c44764`. These results justify retaining the general kernel,
while also showing that four-worker wall latency is now dominated by the
parallel REC phase rather than this DET node alone.

## AVX2 long-axis Softmax

REC Softmax uses a contiguous final axis of 6,906 classes, while CLS Softmax
uses only a short class axis. The new AVX2 path is therefore enabled only for
contiguous axes with at least 256 values. It subtracts the row maximum, uses a
range-reduced FP32 exponential with a Taylor polynomial over the reduced
interval, and keeps the original left-to-right scalar sum order before the
normalization divide. This keeps the recognizer score contract stable while
vectorizing the expensive exponential and normalization passes. Strided and
short-axis Softmax calls retain the original implementation.

Four alternating 20-request, four-worker profiles compared binaries that both
included the regular 3x3 four-output kernel; only the long-axis Softmax path
differed:

| Metric | Scalar Softmax | AVX2 Softmax | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Complete OCR | 103.67 ms | 101.57 ms | -2.03% |
| CLS/REC line wall | 53.19 ms | 50.97 ms | -4.17% |
| Accumulated REC graph work | 148.50 ms | 141.12 ms | -4.97% |

All eight runs retained output checksum `f7bf2108d8c44764`. REC graph reference,
REC pipeline reference, full-OCR reference/profile, scalar kernel, and the
complete Windows x64 Release suite passed after enabling the path. The profile
still reports Softmax as the same public operator, so no ABI or profile schema
change is required.
## REC four-row tiled MatMul

The AVX2 MatMul backend now processes four REC rows together in eight-column tiles for wide
terminal projections. This keeps one weight vector live while applying four broadcast inputs,
reducing repeated weight loads without changing accumulation order.

On the Windows x64 Release sample (20 iterations, four OCR workers), alternating A/B runs were:

| configuration | run 1 | run 2 | run 3 | run 4 | median |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| previous MatMul path | 106.53 ms | 109.64 ms | 109.22 ms | 108.17 ms | 109.22 ms |
| tiled four-row path | 103.90 ms | 104.34 ms | 103.93 ms | 106.39 ms | 104.34 ms |

The median end-to-end improvement is approximately **4.5%**. The output checksum remained
`f7bf2108d8c44764`; the full Windows x64 Release suite passed 34/34 tests.

## Session-packed 16-column MatMul weights

The recognizer's terminal projection multiplies `[1,120,80]` by one constant
`[80,6906]` matrix. On x64 AVX2 sessions, that constant matrix is now packed
once from canonical `[K][N]` order into 16-column panels. A 4x16 microkernel
then loads each packed pair of AVX2 vectors once for four output rows. The
inner-dimension accumulation order is unchanged and FMA remains disabled.
Irregular, small, x86, non-AVX2, and WebAssembly sessions retain the canonical
MatMul path; neither LWM nor the public C ABI changes.

Seven interleaved width-960 REC profiles, five iterations per sample, measured:

| Metric per recognition | Canonical B | Packed B | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Mean MatMul node invocation | 2.10 ms | 0.83 ms | -60.5% |
| Wide `80 x 6906` node | 4.10 ms | 1.55 ms | -62.2% |
| Profiled REC graph total | 23.46 ms | 20.85 ms | -11.1% |

Three additional interleaved full-OCR pairs used three warmups, ten measured
requests, eight REC workers, target width 960, and the 500x500/16-line sample:

| Metric | Canonical B | Packed B | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Complete OCR mean | 117.01 ms | 109.42 ms | -6.49% |
| Complete OCR P95 | 123.95 ms | 116.27 ms | -6.19% |
| Work after DET | 38.65 ms | 30.81 ms | -20.28% |
| Peak RSS | 231.96 MiB | 265.65 MiB | +33.69 MiB |

Every run returned 16 lines. The packed scalar and AVX2 kernels are required
to be byte-identical to canonical MatMul for a shape with a partial final
panel. The REC graph/pipeline and full-OCR Golden corpus passed, as did all
35 Windows x64 and all 35 Windows x86 Release tests.

A cache-level Conv1x1 spatial-blocking prototype was evaluated immediately
before this change. It reduced the isolated pointwise operator by about 13.3%
but improved full OCR by only about 0.35%, below the 2% retention gate, so the
prototype was removed.

## Hardware-aware native worker default

The reusable full-OCR benchmark accepts a final REC maximum-width argument, so
the application configuration can be measured directly instead of silently
falling back to the 320-wide recognizer default:

```text
lw-ocr-benchmark det.lwm cls.lwm rec.lwm ppocr_keys.txt sample.ppm 3 20 8 960
```

On the Windows x64 host with 16 logical processors and 16 GiB RAM, one
20-request pass over the 500x500/16-line fixture produced:

| Workers | Mean OCR | P95 OCR | Throughput | Peak RSS |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4 | 155.91 ms | 166.94 ms | 6.41/s | 162.31 MiB |
| 6 | 137.60 ms | 144.41 ms | 7.27/s | 197.70 MiB |
| 8 | 116.70 ms | 121.28 ms | 8.57/s | 231.90 MiB |
| 10 | 117.12 ms | 126.71 ms | 8.54/s | 238.54 MiB |

Eight workers reduced mean latency by 25.15% relative to four at a cost of
69.59 MiB additional peak RSS. Ten workers did not improve mean or P95 latency.
Native 64-bit defaults therefore use the online logical-processor count capped
at eight; x86 and non-pthread WebAssembly remain at one. Explicit values in
`1..16` remain supported for applications with different latency and memory
budgets. The C# selector and HTTP Demo inherit the same default policy.

After the final build, two additional interleaved 20-request checks measured
4-worker means of 160.71/155.38 ms and 8-worker means of 115.06/115.32 ms.
Their averages were 158.05 ms and 115.19 ms respectively, a 27.12% reduction;
peak RSS remained approximately 162.3 MiB and 231.8 MiB. Omitting the benchmark
worker argument resolved to eight on this 16-logical-processor host.

Two wider-kernel experiments were also rejected during this pass. An AVX2
eight-row REC MatMul tile changed four-worker complete OCR from 157.07 ms to
157.45 ms and increased accumulated MatMul time from 54.96 ms to 57.08 ms. An
AVX2 4x24 pointwise-convolution tile changed complete OCR from 156.42 ms to
167.82 ms and REC Conv1x1 work from 99.97 ms to 140.11 ms. Both retained output
checksum `0ebf8b448ab7df47`, but both implementations were removed because they
made latency worse.

## Width-aware dynamic line scheduling

The adaptive-width OCR path no longer waits for an entire worker-sized crop
batch before dispatching the next lines. It materializes the request's crops,
orders them from the largest REC target width to the smallest, and lets each
worker claim another crop as soon as it finishes. This removes the batch
barrier that previously left faster workers idle behind the slowest line.
Result and text slots remain indexed by detection order, so scheduling does
not change the public result order.

Each worker receives one initial crop whose width is matched to its current
recognizer session when possible. That affinity preserves the two-session
adaptive-width cache on pages whose line count does not exceed the worker
count. The remaining queue uses a Windows interlocked counter, GCC/Clang
relaxed atomic, or the existing single-worker WebAssembly path. Thread creation
failure still falls back to synchronous execution, and neither the C ABI nor
the LWM format changes.

Three interleaved Windows x64 Release pairs used three warmups, twelve measured
requests, maximum REC width 960, and the saved pre-change executable/DLL:

| Input | Workers | Batch barrier | Dynamic queue | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bundled 16-line sample | 4 | 156.43 ms | 141.09 ms | -9.80% |
| Bundled 16-line sample | 8 | 120.55 ms | 111.05 ms | -7.88% |
| Long-line article | 4 | 127.36 ms | 121.12 ms | -4.90% |
| Long-line article | 8 | 108.23 ms | 107.37 ms | -0.80% |

The 16-line sample's mean work after DET fell from 77.92 to 61.24 ms with four
workers and from 39.83 to 30.66 ms with eight. Peak RSS was effectively flat
with four workers and rose from 265.72 to 271.83 MiB with eight because all
sixteen crop images remain available to the queue. On the article, four-worker
peak RSS rose from 174.55 to 186.54 MiB; the eight-worker run remained flat at
about 235.4 MiB after width affinity was added.

The existing full-OCR profile and Golden corpus continue to require the
16-line output, stable operator counts, adaptive-width histogram, and checksum
`0ebf8b448ab7df47`. The long-line article retained eight lines and its
previous text output. A proposed 8x8 AVX2 Conv1x1 spatial tile was also tested
in this pass, but it slowed the isolated pointwise profile by about 5.1% and
the REC graph by about 3.6%, so it was removed before this scheduler change.
All 35 Windows x64 and all 35 Windows x86 Release tests passed. WebAssembly was
left to CI because the local host does not have the WASM toolchain.

## DET 2x2 ConvTranspose output traffic

The AVX2 `groups=1`, 2x2, stride-2, zero-padding ConvTranspose path now folds
bias initialization into the first input-channel pass. Each eight-input block
also keeps all four expanded output vectors in registers until both horizontal
kernel taps have accumulated. This removes the separate output-plane fill,
hoists four weight broadcasts out of the spatial loops, and halves repeated
output loads and stores without using FMA or changing the input-channel
accumulation order. Both DET ConvTranspose nodes continue to use the same
general specialized path; the public C ABI and LWM format are unchanged.

Five interleaved 12-request profiles compared the saved pre-change DLL with the
candidate on the bundled 500x500/16-line sample, eight REC workers, and maximum
REC width 960:

| Metric per request | Previous path | Reduced-traffic path | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DET node 236 | 2.18 ms | 1.41 ms | -35.43% |
| DET graph | 36.51 ms | 35.55 ms | -2.62% |
| Complete profiled OCR | 102.02 ms | 100.16 ms | -1.82% |

Five additional uninstrumented 20-request pairs measured DET mean latency at
78.64 ms versus 76.31 ms, a 2.96% reduction. Complete OCR mean changed from
101.25 ms to 100.87 ms and P95 from 106.29 ms to 105.96 ms; the post-DET worker
phase makes those smaller differences sensitive to host scheduling. Every run
retained 16 lines and checksum `0ebf8b448ab7df47`.

Two follow-up changes to regular 3x3 DET node 234 were rejected. Expanding the
existing four-output AVX2 kernel from one to two spatial vectors slightly
increased node time from 2.82 ms to 2.83 ms. Masked AVX2 handling of each row's
right tail changed node time from 2.96 ms to 2.93 ms across seven interleaved
15-request pairs, but DET graph time increased from 35.98 ms to 36.17 ms and
complete profiled OCR increased from 102.23 ms to 102.86 ms. Both experiments
preserved the output checksum, but neither cleared the retention gate, so both
were removed. Node 234 therefore keeps the previously measured four-output
kernel rather than accumulating unproven complexity.

All 35 Windows x64 and all 35 Windows x86 Release tests passed with the final
reduced-traffic implementation. WebAssembly remains covered by CI because the
local host does not have the WASM toolchain.

## CPU-budget-aware DET intra-op v1

Full OCR no longer derives the detector's intra-op pool size from
`lw_ocr_options.worker_count`. OCR-handle creation now detects process-visible
logical processors, available processors, and physical cores. Native 64-bit
builds give DET an independent physical-core budget capped at eight; x86 and
the single-threaded WebAssembly build keep a budget of one. On Linux, affinity
and cgroup CPU quota constrain the available budget. Failure to inspect any
topology source falls back conservatively and never prevents OCR creation.

The DET session still creates its fixed pool only once. Existing Conv work and
output-channel gates choose the active subset for each invocation, so small
nodes remain serial and SIMD fast paths remain active inside every slice. On
the local 16-processor Windows x64 host, one profiled request selected eight
threads for 31 Conv invocations, four for one, and one for 51. The profile JSON
now records detected topology, configured and actual DET capacity, serial and
parallel Conv counts, and a 1-through-16 thread histogram.

The test-only `full-ocr-intra-benchmark` accepts a final DET intra-op override.
This provides `1/2/4/8` A/B coverage without adding fields or exports to the
public C ABI. With the bundled 500x500, 16-line fixture, maximum REC width 320,
three warm-ups, and 20 measured calls, the same Release AVX2 binary produced:

| CLS/REC workers | DET intra-op | Full OCR mean | Full OCR P95 | RSS |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | 1 | 247.38 ms | 264.84 ms | 74.25 MiB |
| 1 | 8 | 209.27 ms | 223.46 ms | 74.39 MiB |
| 4 | 1 | 133.76 ms | 141.51 ms | 115.51 MiB |
| 4 | 8 | 98.47 ms | 113.25 ms | 115.69 MiB |

Independent DET budgeting reduced complete OCR mean latency by 15.40% with one
line worker and 26.38% with four while steady RSS was effectively unchanged.
All `1/2/4/8` profile runs retained identical text checksum, line count,
operator invocation counts, and adaptive-width histogram. This first version
does not add nested CLS/REC intra-op, MatMul parallelism, a shared task arena,
thread affinity, or NUMA policy; each remains a separate measured experiment.
All 38 Windows x64 and all 38 Windows x86 Release tests passed, including the
ABI/export, full-OCR reference, Golden corpus, profile, and staged-package
gates. Linux and WebAssembly remain final CI compile gates on this Windows host.

## REC node hotspots by adaptive width

The profile driver now emits an additive `rec_nodes` section for the 159-node
recognition graph. Each entry records the node index, operation, accumulated
nanoseconds, invocation count, and the same counters split by the concrete
resized REC width bucket (`192`, `256`, `320`, `480`, `640`, `800`, `960`, or
`other`). The buckets describe the width selected by adaptive preprocessing;
they are not requested-width labels.

The node counters are captured around the existing graph execution and do not
change graph scheduling, arithmetic, the public C ABI, or the LWM format. They
are accumulated worker work, so overlapping line workers can make their sum
larger than request wall time. `tools/collect_native_ocr_profile.py` validates
the additive section and exposes the ten largest REC nodes in the generated
architecture summary. Use that table to choose the next kernel A/B target,
then verify any candidate with the uninstrumented benchmark, text checksum,
Golden corpus, and RSS gates.
