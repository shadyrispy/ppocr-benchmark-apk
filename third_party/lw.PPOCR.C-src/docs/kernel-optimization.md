# Profiled scalar-kernel optimizations

These milestones profile the exact bundled PP-OCRv6 tiny REC graph before
changing a kernel, optimize measured hotspots, and repeat the public end-to-end
benchmark under the same conditions. The figures below are local engineering
measurements, not a performance guarantee.

## Profiling method

An internal, test-only executor entry point accepts a monotonic-clock callback
and accumulates elapsed nanoseconds and invocation counts by LWM operator ID
and node index. The profiler reports Conv input, weight, output, group, kernel,
stride, dilation, and padding metadata, plus MatMul input, weight, output, and
derived matrix dimensions. It also reports Add/Mul/Div input/output shapes and
constant-input flags so broadcasting costs can be classified from resolved
runtime tensors. Optimization targets are therefore selected from evidence.
It does not change the public C ABI, exported symbols, installed headers, or
package contents. The normal executor does not read the clock.

On Windows x64, ten width-320 graph executions produced this initial profile:

| Operator | Time per graph | Share | Nodes per graph |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Conv | 570.928 ms | 95.44% | 37 |
| MatMul | 14.735 ms | 2.46% | 2 |
| Add | 3.829 ms | 0.64% | 52 |
| Erf | 3.200 ms | 0.53% | 10 |
| Mul | 2.710 ms | 0.45% | 25 |

The remaining ten operator types each accounted for less than one millisecond
per graph. Conv was therefore the first optimization target.

## First change: general Conv indexing

The scalar NCHW Conv implementation now:

- computes valid kernel-row and kernel-column ranges before the input-channel
  loop, instead of checking image bounds for every multiply;
- reuses group, channel, row, and weight pointers instead of rebuilding full
  64-bit tensor offsets in the innermost loop;
- preserves the original FP32 accumulation order: input channel, kernel row,
  then kernel column.

There is no im2col allocation, SIMD instruction, thread, or public-interface
change. Normal, grouped, Depthwise, dilated, asymmetric-padding, and
padding-only output regions remain covered by ONNX reference tests.

After the change, the same ten-run profile measured Conv at 350.485 ms per
graph, a 38.6% reduction. Conv remains the dominant hotspot at 92.89%, so
future optimization should continue there before broadening the runtime.

## End-to-end A/B result

Both measurements used the same AMD Ryzen 7 7735H host, Windows 10.0.19045,
MSVC 19.40 Release `/O2` build, scalar FP32 single-thread backend, bundled
model and 295x46 PPM crop, three warm-ups, and twenty measured recognitions.

| Process | Baseline mean | Optimized mean | Latency reduction | Speedup | Baseline throughput | Optimized throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 570.752 ms | 381.206 ms | 33.21% | 1.497x | 1.752/s | 2.623/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 1416.520 ms | 669.329 ms | 52.75% | 2.116x | 0.706/s | 1.494/s | 0 B |

Every call in both optimized runs returned exactly `纯臻营养护发素` with score
`0.998993874`. The complete REC graph remains reference-matched against ONNX,
and the ten-crop Golden Corpus remains unchanged.

## Second profile: pointwise Conv

The node-level profile after the first change showed that 25 ordinary
`1x1`, group-1, unit-stride, zero-padding Conv nodes consumed 341.150 ms per
graph, or 96.24% of all Conv time. Depthwise Conv was below 1% and was not an
appropriate next target.

The second change adds a general fast path for `1x1`, unit-stride,
unit-dilation, zero-padding Conv. It supports batch and groups. For each output
channel it initializes the contiguous output plane with bias, then visits input
channels in the original order while updating the whole spatial plane. This
changes memory traversal from channel-strided input reads to contiguous reads
and writes while preserving each output element's FP32 accumulation order.

The source uses portable C11 and adds no allocation, intrinsic, assembly,
thread, public ABI, or runtime CPU-dispatch requirement. An additional batched,
grouped 1x1 case is compared with ONNX ReferenceEvaluator.

On Windows x64, the ten-run profile after this change measured all Conv at
25.379 ms per graph. Pointwise Conv fell from 341.150 ms to 10.696 ms. The two
ordinary 3x3 nodes are now the largest Conv targets.

## Second end-to-end A/B result

The following 3+20 runs use the same protocol and fixture as the baseline and
first optimization:

| Process | First optimized mean | Pointwise optimized mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline reduction | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 381.206 ms | 51.495 ms | 86.49% | 7.403x | 90.98% | 11.084x | 19.419/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 669.329 ms | 139.297 ms | 79.19% | 4.805x | 90.17% | 10.169x | 7.179/s | 0 B |

Every measured call again returned exactly `纯臻营养护发素` with score
`0.998993874`. The ONNX complete-graph comparison, ten-crop Golden Corpus,
deterministic-repeat check, and x64/x86 reference tests remain green.

## Third profile: ordinary 3x3 downsampling Conv

After pointwise optimization, the remaining Conv profile identified two
ordinary `3x3`, stride-2, unit-dilation, pad-1, group-1 nodes. They consumed
about 10.76 ms per graph on Windows x64, or 43.6% of Conv time.

The third change adds a portable-C path for this shape. It initializes each
output plane once, then scans valid output positions in input-channel,
kernel-row, kernel-column order. Input and output traversal is spatially local,
while the FP32 addition order for each output element remains unchanged. The
existing ONNX reference case exercises the same path with an odd input width,
covering the right-edge boundary.

Across five repeated node profiles, the median measurement for those two nodes
was 5.601 ms after the change, a 47.94% reduction. Median total Conv time was
19.150 ms, 24.54% below the prior 25.379 ms measurement. The full operator
profile is now more balanced: median Conv share is 43.38% and MatMul is 29.33%,
so the two-node MatMul implementation becomes the next concentrated target.

## Third end-to-end A/B result

| Process | Pointwise optimized mean | 3x3 optimized mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 51.495 ms | 44.444 ms | 13.69% | 1.159x | 12.842x | 22.500/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 139.297 ms | 126.773 ms | 8.99% | 1.099x | 11.174x | 7.888/s | 0 B |

The optimized mean and throughput values are medians from five repeated 3+20
runs. Every run retained the exact text and score, deterministic output, and
zero measured RSS growth.

## Fourth profile: shared-weight MatMul

Five repeated 20-iteration profiles identified the exact MatMul shapes:

| Node | Input | Shared weights | Output | Median time |
|---:|---|---|---|---:|
| 156 | `1x40x160` | `160x80` | `1x40x80` | 0.273 ms |
| 158 | `1x40x80` | `80x6906` | `1x40x6906` | 13.693 ms |

The original column-outer loop crossed the 6906-column weight stride for each
multiply. The fourth change initializes four output rows at a time, visits the
inner dimension in the original order, and scans the corresponding weight row
and output row contiguously across columns. Reusing that weight row across four
outputs reduced memory traffic without an allocation, intrinsic, assembly,
thread, public ABI, or CPU-dispatch change.

The existing batched `2x3x4` by `4x5` reference case covers multiple batches,
multiple rows, and a non-multiple-of-four column tail. Complete REC ONNX output,
ten-crop Golden Corpus, deterministic-repeat, alias validation, and x64/x86
tests remain unchanged.

Across five final x64 profiles, median MatMul time was 5.970 ms, down 57.23%
from 13.957 ms (2.338x). The large node fell to 5.844 ms. Median operator time
was 38.586 ms: Conv 19.308 ms, MatMul 5.970 ms, Add 4.263 ms, and Erf 3.129 ms.
MatMul is now 15.40% of measured operator time instead of 29.33%.

## Fourth end-to-end A/B result

| Process | 3x3 optimized mean | MatMul optimized mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 44.444 ms | 37.405 ms | 15.84% | 1.188x | 15.259x | 26.734/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 126.773 ms | 115.728 ms | 8.71% | 1.095x | 12.240x | 8.641/s | 0 B |

These are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs after a clean Release build.
Every run returned exactly `纯臻营养护发素` with score `0.998993874`, was
bit-deterministic within the run, and reported zero RSS growth.

## Fifth profile: runtime-dispatched SSE2 MatMul

Release disassembly showed the portable MatMul column loop still used scalar
`mulss/addss` instructions under MSVC `/O2`. The fifth change therefore adds:

- architecture-isolated CPU detection under `src/simd`;
- x64 SSE2 selection as an architectural baseline and x86 CPUID feature-bit
  validation, with scalar fallback elsewhere;
- an explicit four-column `mulps/addps` MatMul loop plus the existing scalar
  tail;
- a dynamic `scalar` or `sse2` value in the benchmark JSON `backend` field.

There is no public C ABI, allocation, thread, model, workspace, or package
layout change. The tensor reference driver executes both scalar and dispatched
MatMul for batched rows and five columns, requires byte-identical output, and
then checks both against NumPy. Complete graph, ONNX, Golden Corpus,
deterministic-repeat, x64/x86, and installed-package gates remain mandatory.

Across five x64 profiles, median MatMul time fell from 5.970 ms to 2.845 ms,
a 52.34% reduction (2.098x). Release disassembly confirmed `mulps/addps` in
both x64 and x86 objects. Median measured operator time was 35.345 ms and
MatMul's share fell from 15.40% to about 8.05%.

## Fifth end-to-end A/B result

| Process | Scalar MatMul mean | SSE2 mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 37.405 ms | 35.344 ms | 5.51% | 1.058x | 16.148x | 28.293/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 115.728 ms | 114.763 ms | 0.83% | 1.008x | 12.343x | 8.714/s | 0 B |

These values are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs. Every call retained the
exact text and score, every benchmark identified the selected backend as
`sse2`, and every run reported zero RSS growth.

## Sixth profile: runtime-dispatched AVX2 MatMul

The sixth change widens the explicit SIMD path while keeping dispatch safe on
older CPUs and operating systems:

- CPUID verifies AVX, OSXSAVE, and AVX2 support, while XGETBV verifies that the
  operating system saves both XMM and YMM state;
- an isolated eight-column AVX2 loop uses `vmulps/vaddps`, followed by the same
  scalar tail;
- SSE2 and scalar implementations remain the automatic fallbacks;
- the benchmark reports `avx2` when that implementation is selected.

There is no public C ABI, allocation, thread, model, workspace, or package
layout change. Direct scalar, SSE2, AVX2, and dispatched tensor checks require
byte-identical MatMul output on supported hardware before NumPy comparison.
Release x64 and x86 disassembly confirmed `vmulps/vaddps` and `vzeroupper` in
the isolated AVX2 object and confirmed that no fused multiply-add instruction
was emitted. The CPU-detection object contains no AVX instruction before the
runtime checks.

Across five x64 profiles, median MatMul time fell from 2.845 ms with SSE2 to
1.906 ms with AVX2, a 33.01% reduction (1.493x). Relative to the portable
row-blocked scalar implementation's 5.970 ms, the reduction is 68.07% (3.132x).
Median measured operator time was 34.036 ms and MatMul's share fell to 5.58%.
On x86, MatMul fell from 2.869 ms to 1.898 ms, a 33.84% reduction (1.511x).

## Sixth end-to-end A/B result

| Process | SSE2 mean | AVX2 mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 35.344 ms | 33.324 ms | 5.72% | 1.061x | 17.128x | 30.009/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 114.763 ms | 112.594 ms | 1.89% | 1.019x | 12.581x | 8.881/s | 0 B |

These values are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs. Every call retained the
exact text and score, every benchmark identified the selected backend as
`avx2`, and every run reported zero RSS growth. With MatMul at 5.58% of the x64
operator profile, pointwise Conv SIMD is the next measured candidate.

## Seventh profile: runtime-dispatched pointwise Conv SIMD

Release disassembly of the portable pointwise loop showed partial SSE2
auto-vectorization on x64 but only scalar instructions on x86. Five pre-change
profiles measured median pointwise totals of 10.000 ms on x64 and 69.400 ms on
x86. The seventh change therefore adds:

- isolated four-spatial-element SSE2 and eight-spatial-element AVX2 loops;
- the existing CPUID/OSXSAVE/XGETBV runtime hierarchy and scalar fallback;
- support for batch and groups without changing the NCHW tensor layout;
- separate multiply and add operations that retain each spatial element's
  input-channel accumulation order.

There is no public C ABI, allocation, thread, model, workspace, or package
layout change. A grouped pointwise reference case uses a ten-element spatial
plane so both vector bodies and scalar tails execute. The test driver compares
scalar, direct SSE2, direct AVX2, and automatic dispatch byte for byte before
the ONNX reference comparison. Release disassembly confirmed `mulps/addps` in
the SSE2 objects and `vmulps/vaddps/vzeroupper` in the AVX2 objects for both x64
and x86, with no FMA instructions.

Across five final profiles, x64 pointwise time fell from 10.000 ms to 5.502 ms,
a 44.98% reduction (1.817x), while total Conv fell from 18.994 ms to 14.432 ms.
On x86, pointwise time fell from 69.400 ms to 14.350 ms, a 79.32% reduction
(4.836x), while total Conv fell from 79.867 ms to 25.914 ms.

## Seventh end-to-end A/B result

| Process | Prior mean | SIMD pointwise mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 34.164 ms | 29.504 ms | 13.64% | 1.158x | 19.345x | 33.893/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 114.499 ms | 59.540 ms | 48.00% | 1.923x | 23.791x | 16.795/s | 0 B |

These values are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs. Every call retained the
exact text and score, every benchmark identified the selected backend as
`avx2`, and every run reported zero RSS growth. The remaining profile is now
spread across ordinary/depthwise Conv and elementwise operators, so another
target should be selected only after a fresh node-level comparison.

## Eighth profile: flat binary SIMD

The expanded profile classified 87 binary nodes by resolved runtime shape. Of
these, 25 use two same-shaped contiguous inputs and 30 use a contiguous left
input with a scalar right input. The remaining 32 use channel or trailing-vector
broadcasting. Five pre-change profiles measured median Add/Mul/Div totals of
7.854 ms on x64 and 15.981 ms on x86, making the two flat modes a larger and
lower-risk target than another convolution shape specialization.

The eighth change adds:

- direct contiguous-pair and contiguous-plus-right-scalar loops for Add, Mul,
  and Div;
- isolated four-value SSE2 and eight-value AVX2 implementations with scalar
  tails and the existing runtime fallback hierarchy;
- unchanged validation and general coordinate traversal for every other
  NumPy/ONNX broadcast pattern;
- binary-node shape and constant metadata in the private profiler.

There is no public C ABI, allocation, thread, model, workspace, or package
layout change. Ten-value direct tests exercise non-vector-aligned tails and
require scalar, direct SSE2, direct AVX2, and dispatched output to match byte
for byte for all six pair/scalar operation combinations before NumPy comparison.
Release disassembly confirmed `addps/mulps/divps` and
`vaddps/vmulps/vdivps/vzeroupper` in both x64 and x86 objects, with no FMA.

Across five final profiles, the x64 Add/Mul/Div median total fell from 7.854 ms
to 3.066 ms, a 60.97% reduction (2.562x). The x86 total fell from 15.981 ms to
6.511 ms, a 59.26% reduction (2.454x). Complex broadcast Add remains untouched
and accounts for most of the remaining binary time.

## Eighth end-to-end A/B result

| Process | Prior mean | Flat binary SIMD mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 29.537 ms | 25.295 ms | 14.36% | 1.168x | 22.564x | 39.534/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 59.349 ms | 49.291 ms | 16.95% | 1.204x | 28.738x | 20.288/s | 0 B |

These values are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs. Every call retained the
exact text and score, every benchmark identified the selected backend as
`avx2`, and every run reported zero RSS growth.

## Ninth profile: single-axis binary broadcast blocks

A fresh shape-class profile compared the 32 binary nodes left on the general
broadcast path with the remaining convolution classes. Every one of those
binary nodes has a contiguous left/output tensor and exactly one non-unit right
dimension: 30 are NCHW channel broadcasts and two repeat a matched trailing
vector. Their five-run medians were 2.743 ms on x64 and 6.277 ms on x86. The
x86 broadcast total exceeded either ordinary 3x3 or depthwise Conv, while the
x64 path offered a smaller but isolated target with no accumulation-order risk.

The ninth change adds no new arithmetic kernel. Instead, after the existing
shape validation it:

- detects the single non-unit aligned right dimension;
- splits channel-style layouts into contiguous inner blocks and reuses the
  existing right-scalar AVX2/SSE2/scalar loop;
- splits trailing-vector layouts into outer slices and reuses the existing
  contiguous-pair loop;
- detects the CPU SIMD level once for the complete broadcast operation;
- retains the general coordinate traversal for broadcasts with multiple
  non-unit right dimensions.

There is no public C ABI, allocation, thread, model, workspace, arithmetic, or
package-layout change. NumPy reference tests cover channel blocks for Add, Mul,
and Div, a ten-value trailing vector with a scalar SIMD tail, and a two-axis
broadcast that must remain on the general fallback. Full graph and Golden tests
retain the exact output.

Across five final profiles, the x64 single-axis broadcast median fell from
2.743 ms to 0.303 ms, an 88.95% reduction (9.050x). The x86 median fell from
6.277 ms to 0.400 ms, a 93.63% reduction (15.700x). The corresponding
end-to-end reductions closely match the removed broadcast cost.

## Ninth end-to-end A/B result

| Process | Prior mean | Broadcast-block mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 26.221 ms | 23.672 ms | 9.72% | 1.108x | 24.111x | 42.244/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 51.674 ms | 45.874 ms | 11.22% | 1.126x | 30.878x | 21.799/s | 0 B |

These values are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs. Every call retained the
exact text and score, every benchmark identified the selected backend as
`avx2`, and every run reported zero RSS growth. Ordinary 3x3 and depthwise Conv
are now the next measured single-thread targets.

## Tenth profile: stride-1 Depthwise 3x3 SIMD

After removing the broadcast-coordinate cost, a fresh Conv shape profile found
seven Depthwise nodes with identical 3x3, stride-1, dilation-1, pad-1 geometry.
Their five-run medians were 3.039 ms on x64 and 4.753 ms on x86. Two additional
Depthwise nodes use stride 2x1 and remain on the general implementation. The
ordinary 3x3 candidates use stride 2x2, whose non-contiguous horizontal input
access makes them a higher-complexity SIMD target.

The tenth change adds:

- a portable, weight-major specialization for the exact unit-stride Depthwise
  shape;
- isolated four-column SSE2 and eight-column AVX2 implementations with scalar
  boundaries and row tails;
- the existing CPUID/OSXSAVE/XGETBV dispatch hierarchy and non-x86 scalar
  fallback;
- strict matching of one output channel per input group, leaving depth
  multipliers and every other grouped shape on the general path.

Each output element starts with the same bias and receives valid kernel terms
in the original row-major nine-weight order. A 4x10 direct reference exercises
top/bottom/left/right boundaries, both vector widths, and scalar tails. Direct
SSE2, direct AVX2, automatic dispatch, and the portable specialization must be
byte-identical before comparison with ONNX ReferenceEvaluator. Release
disassembly confirmed separate `mulps/addps` and `vmulps/vaddps/vzeroupper` in
both x64 and x86 objects, with no FMA.

Across five final profiles, the x64 target-node median fell from 3.039 ms to
0.266 ms, a 91.26% reduction (11.439x). The x86 median fell from 4.753 ms to
0.383 ms, a 91.95% reduction (12.415x). The two untouched stride-2x1 Depthwise
nodes remained near their prior cost.

## Tenth end-to-end A/B result

| Process | Prior mean | Depthwise SIMD mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 24.142 ms | 21.345 ms | 11.59% | 1.131x | 26.739x | 46.849/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 46.368 ms | 43.023 ms | 7.21% | 1.078x | 32.925x | 23.243/s | 0 B |

These values are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs. Every call retained the
exact text and score, every benchmark identified the selected backend as
`avx2`, and every run reported zero RSS growth. The two ordinary stride-2 3x3
Conv nodes are now the largest remaining single-thread shape class.

## Eleventh profile: ordinary stride-2 3x3 SIMD

After the Depthwise work, the two ordinary stem nodes remained a distinct
shape class: `1x3x48x320 -> 1x24x24x160` and
`1x24x24x160 -> 1x48x12x80`. Both use group 1, 3x3 kernels, stride 2,
unit dilation, and pad 1. Fresh five-run medians measured 5.435 ms on x64 and
4.969 ms on x86.

The eleventh change adds:

- isolated SSE2 and AVX2 implementations for the already-specialized ordinary
  stride-2 3x3 shape;
- contiguous input loads followed by even-lane deinterleaving, producing four
  SSE2 or eight AVX2 output columns without gather instructions;
- explicit row-bound checks before every vector body, with scalar borders and
  tails;
- the existing AVX2-to-SSE2-to-scalar runtime hierarchy and non-x86 portable
  fallback.

The loop nesting remains output channel, input channel, kernel row, and kernel
column. Vector lanes only combine independent output positions, so each output
receives the same bias and floating-point additions in the same order as the
portable specialization. A `1x2x5x18` direct reference covers all borders,
both vector widths, and scalar tails. Direct SSE2, direct AVX2, automatic
dispatch, and scalar output must be byte-identical before comparison with ONNX
ReferenceEvaluator. Release disassembly confirmed `mulps/addps/shufps` and
`vmulps/vaddps/vshufps/vzeroupper` in both architectures, with no FMA.

Across five final profiles, the x64 target median fell from 5.435 ms to
1.989 ms, a 63.40% reduction (2.732x). The x86 median fell from 4.969 ms to
2.582 ms, a 48.03% reduction (1.924x).

## Eleventh end-to-end A/B result

| Process | Prior mean | Stride-2 SIMD mean | Further reduction | Further speedup | Original baseline speedup | Throughput | RSS growth |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Windows x64 | 21.367 ms | 18.865 ms | 11.71% | 1.133x | 30.255x | 53.010/s | 0 B |
| Windows x86 | 41.951 ms | 38.833 ms | 7.43% | 1.080x | 36.477x | 25.751/s | 0 B |

These values are medians from five repeated 3+20 runs. Every call retained the
exact text and score, every benchmark identified the selected backend as
`avx2`, and every run reported zero RSS growth. The remaining graph is now more
balanced, so another complete profile should precede the next optimization.

All results in this document describe one machine, compiler, model, and
fixture. They should be reproduced on target machines before being used for
capacity planning.

## Small REC packed 1x1 Conv microbenchmark

Small REC spends most of its graph time in Conv, with repeated pointwise layers
using substantially larger channel counts than Tiny. The private
`packed-conv1x1-benchmark-driver` isolates four representative geometries at
REC widths 320 and 960. It first requires the dispatched result to be
byte-identical to the scalar packed implementation, then reports scalar and
selected-backend latency as JSON. CI runs width 320 with one iteration as a
correctness and output-contract smoke test; it deliberately does not enforce a
timing threshold across unlike CPUs.

On the current Windows x64 AVX2 machine, 20-iteration width-960 measurements
were:

| Input channels | Output channels | Spatial plane | Scalar | AVX2 dispatch | Speedup |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 96 | 192 | 12x240 | 36.563 ms | 1.328 ms | 27.54x |
| 192 | 384 | 6x240 | 72.523 ms | 2.507 ms | 28.93x |
| 384 | 768 | 3x240 | 145.013 ms | 4.297 ms | 33.75x |

Two wider schedules were rejected after measurement. An eight-output schedule
failed to produce a stable end-to-end or operator-level improvement. A x64
AVX2 `4 outputs x 24 spatial values` schedule also preserved byte-identical
results, but a serial 20-iteration comparison regressed every representative
Small REC shape versus the existing `4 x 16` kernel: about 26% to 61% on the
first three width-960 cases, with an even larger unstable regression on the
highest-channel case. Twelve live accumulators, three input vectors, and a
broadcast weight exhaust the sixteen-register YMM file and leave too little
freedom for the compiler scheduler. Future
packed-layout or microkernel changes should use this driver for isolated A/B
evidence, followed by complete Small OCR checksum and latency tests before
being retained.

## Small REC stride-2 3x3 Conv microbenchmark

The Small REC width-960 node profile identified node 11 as the remaining
ordinary 3x3 hotspot: `1x96x24x480 -> 1x48x12x240`, stride 2, dilation 1, and
pad 1. The private `conv3x3-stride2-benchmark-driver` covers both this shape
and the `1x3x48x960 -> 1x48x24x480` stem, with corresponding width-320 cases.
It compares both the canonical automatic dispatch and an output-tile-8 packed
weight path byte-for-byte with the portable specialized implementation before
emitting JSON timings. CI runs a one-iteration width-320 contract smoke and
does not enforce hardware-dependent timing thresholds.

On the current Windows x64 AVX2 machine, ten-iteration width-960 measurements
were:

| Shape | Canonical AVX2 | Packed AVX2 | Reduction | Speedup |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `3x48x960 -> 48x24x480` | 0.761 ms | 0.690 ms | 9.29% | 1.102x |
| `96x24x480 -> 48x12x240` | 9.986 ms | 8.706 ms | 12.82% | 1.147x |

Two existing alternatives were measured on the high-channel shape and
rejected. The four-output path took 10.389 ms, about 7.7% slower than the
eight-output path. The output-stream path took 16.865 ms, about 75.9% slower.
Both remained byte-identical, so the result isolates performance rather than
numeric behavior.

The retained x64 AVX2 change packs eligible constant weights once during
Session creation as `[OC/8][IC][3][3][8]`, then reuses the packed buffer for
every execution. Eligibility is limited to group-1 stride-2 3x3 convolutions
on long REC-like feature maps; DET and non-x64 backends remain unchanged. The
two Small REC nodes add about 167 KiB per concrete REC Session.

In three repeated 2+5 complete Small OCR runs at width 960, the one-worker
median fell from 1439.74 ms to 1417.21 ms (1.56%), and the four-worker median
fell from 612.46 ms to 603.58 ms (1.45%). The post-DET portion improved by
1.67% and 2.81% respectively, with the same 16-line result contract.

## Small REC unit-stride 2x2 Conv microkernel

The Small REC profile also contains two unit-stride 2x2 convolutions with
bottom/right pad 1: node 3 (`1x48x24x480 -> 1x24x24x480`) and node 6
(`1x24x24x480 -> 1x48x24x480`). The previous SSE2 and AVX2 implementations
processed one output channel at a time, so every output channel reloaded the
same input vector. The retained path processes four output channels together,
reusing that input vector across four accumulators. It keeps the existing
portable scalar path and public dispatch unchanged; only the eligible
four-output SSE2/AVX2 shapes use the microkernel. No workspace or model-format
change is required.

The convolution reference fixture compares the scalar, public-dispatch, SSE2,
and AVX2 results bit-for-bit, including a non-vector-aligned width. On the
same Windows x64 AVX2 machine, three 30-iteration width-960 profiles measured
the following per-node totals:

| REC node | Previous SIMD path | Four-output path | Reduction |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 (`48x24x480 -> 24x24x480`) | 107.854 ms | 61.171 ms | 43.28% |
| 6 (`24x24x480 -> 48x24x480`) | 110.208 ms | 63.250 ms | 42.61% |

The complete Small 500x500 OCR profile retained 16 lines and the same output
checksum (`f635a7be50e95247`). Across three runs at REC width 960, mean wall
latency changed from 5068.97 ms to 5054.77 ms with one worker (0.28%), and
from 2750.29 ms to 2694.51 ms with four workers (2.03%). These are local
engineering measurements rather than portable release gates; the isolated
node improvement is the reason to retain the change.

## Full OCR line-level parallelism

The OpenCV reference implementation gains multi-line throughput from multiple
recognition predictors. The pure-C equivalent gives each full-OCR worker its
own CLS/REC model, session, and reusable buffers. DET reuses a fixed,
session-owned thread pool for large output-channel-parallel convolutions, then
crops are processed in batches of at most `worker_count`; Windows uses native
threads and Linux/macOS use pthreads. These phases never overlap, so DET
operator parallelism is not nested inside line parallelism. WebAssembly and x86
default to one worker, while native 64-bit builds use the online logical-
processor count capped at eight. The public OCR handle remains non-reentrant.

DET no longer copies the public line-worker count. Native 64-bit OCR handles
detect process affinity, container CPU quota where available, and physical-core
topology once during creation. The DET pool uses that independent budget capped
at eight; individual Conv nodes still keep the established work gate and select
only as many active workers as their output-channel task count justifies. x86
and the single-file WebAssembly build remain serial.

The crop buffer holds only the active batch rather than every detected line,
so peak crop memory scales with worker count instead of page line count. Thread
creation failure falls back to synchronous processing of the affected range.
Output is written to disjoint fixed slots and compacted in detector reading
order after workers join.

On the local Windows x64 500x500/16-line fixture, the same Release AVX2 binary
measured 862.322 ms with one worker and 626.414 ms with four workers (3 warm-up
+ 8 measured calls). That is a 27.36% full-pipeline reduction. The stage after
DET fell from 356.226 ms to 119.818 ms, while steady RSS rose from 67.58 MiB to
98.02 MiB. The complete full-OCR Golden and public C Demo retained the expected
16 UTF-8 lines, scores, coordinates, and rotation metadata.
