# C API and ABI v1 freeze candidate

The high-level REC, CLS, DET, and full-OCR portions of `include/lw_infer.h`
are prepared as the C ABI v1 freeze-candidate for the next preview release,
planned as `v0.2.0-preview.2`. The currently published preview remains
`v0.2.0-preview.1`; this candidate is not a permanent ABI guarantee yet; see
`docs/c-abi-v1-candidate.md` and `abi/exports-v1-candidate.txt` for the exact
scope and release gates.

The same header also contains low-level model/session planning APIs. Those
remain experimental and may change before 1.0. The high-level API covers
recognize-only, direction-classification, text-detection, and full-OCR calls
for decoded BGR8 pixels. The recognizer hides preprocessing, graph execution,
dictionary indexing, and UTF-8 CTC decoding. The classifier hides
resize/pad/normalize,
graph execution, and the two-class 0/180-degree decision.
The detector hides resize/normalize, dynamic graph planning and execution,
DB-style postprocessing, and original-coordinate quadrilateral restoration.
The full-OCR handle composes those components with pure-C perspective crop and
optional direction correction.

## Ownership and thread model

- `lw_model_load` creates a read-only model handle; `lw_model_free` destroys it.
- `lw_session_create` creates an independent resolved tensor table and workspace.
- A model must outlive every session created from it.
- Separate sessions do not share mutable workspace and may later run in parallel.
- A single session is not promised to be safe for concurrent calls.
- `lw_recognizer_create` owns its model, dictionary, session, and reusable
  input/output buffers until `lw_recognizer_free`.
- Source BGR pixels and output text remain caller-owned.
- Recognition performs no heap allocation after successful creation.
- A single recognizer must not be called concurrently. Separate recognizers
  own independent mutable state and may run in parallel.
- `lw_classifier_create` owns its model, session, and reusable input/output
  buffers until `lw_classifier_free`; classification performs no heap
  allocation after successful creation.
- A single classifier must not be called concurrently. Separate classifiers
  own independent mutable state and may run in parallel.
- `lw_detector_create` owns its model, current dynamic session, and reusable
  inference tensors until `lw_detector_free`. Postprocessing uses bounded
  transient scratch memory.
- A single detector must not be called concurrently. Separate detectors own
  independent mutable state and may run in parallel.
- `lw_ocr_create` owns its detector, one CLS/REC pair per configured worker,
  their model handles/sessions, and reusable line/text/crop scratch until
  `lw_ocr_free`.
- Full OCR crops and processes at most `worker_count` lines per batch. Its crop
  buffer grows to the largest such batch encountered and is then reused.
  The detector reuses a fixed thread pool of the same size for large
  output-channel-parallel convolutions before line workers begin. Detection
  postprocessing may also use bounded transient memory.
- A single full-OCR handle must not be called concurrently. Separate handles
  own independent mutable state and may run in parallel.
- Every successful create has one matching free; all free functions accept null.

Paths passed to the library are UTF-8. The Windows implementation converts to
UTF-16 before opening a file.

## REC session planning

The exact v0.1 REC model has one FP32 input. The descriptor must be:

```text
[N, 3, 48, W]
```

`N` and `W` are positive runtime values. A width that collapses below a valid
spatial output is rejected with `LW_STATUS_INVALID_SHAPE`.

Session creation performs all of the following before returning:

1. validates descriptor size, dtype, rank, dimensions, and unused fields;
2. propagates concrete shapes through all 159 nodes;
3. checks every resolved tensor byte multiplication and `max_tensor_size`;
4. computes tensor birth and last-use nodes;
5. assigns reusable 64-byte-aligned workspace ranges with first-fit allocation;
6. checks `max_workspace_size` and allocates one aligned workspace block.

Default limits are 256 MiB for one tensor and 512 MiB for a session workspace.
Passing zero for either initialized option keeps its default.

## Minimal planning example

```c
lw_model* model = NULL;
lw_session* session = NULL;
lw_error error;
lw_tensor_desc input;
lw_tensor_desc output;
lw_session_info info;

lw_error_init(&error);
if (lw_model_load("rec.lwm", NULL, &model, &error) != LW_STATUS_OK) {
    /* error.code and error.message are available here */
}

lw_tensor_desc_init(&input);
input.dtype = LW_DTYPE_F32;
input.rank = 4;
input.dimensions[0] = 1;
input.dimensions[1] = 3;
input.dimensions[2] = 48;
input.dimensions[3] = 320;

if (lw_session_create(model, &input, 1, NULL, &session, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
    lw_session_info_init(&info);
    lw_tensor_desc_init(&output);
    lw_session_get_info(session, &info);
    lw_session_get_output_desc(session, 0, &output);
    /* output is [1, 40, 6906] for width 320 */
}

lw_session_free(session);
lw_model_free(model);
```

The low-level session planner still accepts no input data pointer. Applications
should use the recognizer API for completed REC inference; the internal executor
is not an integration contract and may change without ABI notice. Its
`lw_tensor_desc_init` helper and `lw_model_*`/`lw_session_*` symbols remain
outside the v1 freeze-candidate allowlist.

## Public REC recognizer

`lw_recognizer_create` accepts UTF-8 paths to one compatible REC `.lwm` model
and dictionary. Its options have these defaults:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `target_width` | 960 | Model input width; input height is fixed at 48 |
| `max_model_file_size` | 1 GiB | Model loader limit |
| `max_workspace_size` | 512 MiB | Planned session workspace limit |
| `max_tensor_size` | 256 MiB | Per-tensor limit |
| `max_image_pixels` | 40,000,000 | Decoded source pixel limit |

Zero option values retain their defaults. Reserved fields must remain zero.
Creation rejects a dictionary whose class count does not match the model.

`lw_recognizer_recognize_bgr_u8` accepts interleaved BGR unsigned-byte pixels,
the accessible source byte count, width, height, and row stride. It does not
accept JPEG/PNG file bytes. The source byte count and stride allow the runtime
to reject truncated or invalid layouts before reading pixels.

Text is NUL-terminated UTF-8 in a caller-owned buffer. Call
`lw_recognizer_get_info` and allocate `max_text_capacity` once for the usual
single-pass path. Alternatively, pass a null text pointer and zero capacity;
recognition still runs and returns the exact `required_text_capacity`, so a
second call is required to obtain text. An undersized buffer returns
`LW_STATUS_OUT_OF_BOUNDS`, never partial text.

`lw_recognition_result` reports the emitted CTC entry count, mean score, actual
resized content width, output time steps, and required text capacity. Initialize
every public structure with its matching `_init` function before use.

```c
lw_recognizer* recognizer = NULL;
lw_recognizer_options options;
lw_recognizer_info info;
lw_recognition_result result;
lw_error error;
char* text;

lw_recognizer_options_init(&options);
lw_error_init(&error);
if (lw_recognizer_create("rec.lwm", "ppocr_keys.txt", &options,
                         &recognizer, &error) != LW_STATUS_OK) {
    /* error.code and error.message */
}

lw_recognizer_info_init(&info);
lw_recognizer_get_info(recognizer, &info);
text = (char*)malloc((size_t)info.max_text_capacity);

lw_recognition_result_init(&result);
lw_error_init(&error);
if (lw_recognizer_recognize_bgr_u8(
        recognizer, bgr, bgr_byte_count, width, height, stride,
        text, info.max_text_capacity, &result, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
    /* text is UTF-8; result.score and result.emitted_count are valid */
}

free(text);
lw_recognizer_free(recognizer);
```

## Public CLS classifier

`lw_classifier_create` accepts a UTF-8 path to the compatible fixed-batch CLS
`.lwm` model. Its input is fixed at `[1,3,80,160]`. The options expose the same
model, workspace, tensor, and decoded-image limits as the recognizer; zero
values retain initialized defaults and reserved fields must remain zero.

`lw_classifier_classify_bgr_u8` accepts interleaved BGR unsigned-byte pixels,
accessible byte count, width, height, and row stride. It preserves aspect ratio,
resizes to height 80, right-pads with zero-valued BGR pixels, normalizes to
`[-1,1]`, and executes the two-class model. It does not decode JPEG/PNG bytes.

`lw_classification_result.label` is `0` for upright and `1` for 180 degrees;
`orientation_degrees` exposes the same decision as `0` or `180`. `score` is the
selected Softmax probability and `resized_width` reports the non-padding width.
The classifier reports orientation only—it does not rotate caller-owned pixels.

```c
lw_classifier* classifier = NULL;
lw_classifier_options options;
lw_classification_result result;
lw_error error;

lw_classifier_options_init(&options);
lw_error_init(&error);
if (lw_classifier_create("cls.lwm", &options, &classifier, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
    lw_classification_result_init(&result);
    if (lw_classifier_classify_bgr_u8(
            classifier, bgr, bgr_byte_count, width, height, stride,
            &result, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
        /* result.orientation_degrees is 0 or 180; result.score is valid. */
    }
}
lw_classifier_free(classifier);
```

## Public DET detector

`lw_detector_create` accepts a UTF-8 path to the compatible dynamic-shape DET
`.lwm` model. Initialized options default to:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `limit_side_length` | 960 | Maximum source long side before resize |
| `max_candidates` | 1,000 | Maximum connected components examined |
| `use_dilation` | 0 | Enable optional 2x2 bitmap dilation |
| `bitmap_threshold` | 0.3 | Probability-map foreground threshold |
| `box_threshold` | 0.6 | Minimum region score |
| `unclip_ratio` | 1.6 | Rectangle expansion factor |
| `max_image_pixels` | 40,000,000 | Decoded source pixel limit |

The model file, workspace, and tensor limits share the REC/CLS defaults.
Reserved fields must remain zero. `limit_side_length` is capped at 4,096,
`max_candidates` at 10,000, and `unclip_ratio` at 10.0.

`lw_detector_detect_bgr_u8` accepts decoded, interleaved BGR bytes with an
accessible byte count and row stride. Each `lw_detection_box` contains four
clockwise points beginning near the top-left, a region score, and a reserved
zero field. Coordinates are floating-point values clamped to the original
image.

Detection boxes use `LW_READING_ORDER_HORIZONTAL_LTR` by default, preserving
the historical top-to-bottom/left-to-right ordering. Applications that process
traditional vertical text can select `LW_READING_ORDER_VERTICAL_RTL` (right
column to left column) or `LW_READING_ORDER_VERTICAL_LTR` before detection:

~~~c
lw_error error;
lw_error_init(&error);
if (lw_detector_set_reading_order(
        detector, LW_READING_ORDER_VERTICAL_RTL, &error) != LW_STATUS_OK) {
    /* inspect error.message */
}
~~~

The setter changes only the order of returned boxes; it does not change
geometry, scores, recognition, model execution, or the LWM format. Handles
must not be used concurrently, so configure the policy before a call. The
corresponding `lw_detector_get_reading_order` and
`lw_ocr_set/get_reading_order` functions use the same stable `uint32_t` values.

For an efficient single call, obtain `lw_detector_info.max_candidates` and
allocate that many boxes. For exact allocation, pass null boxes with zero
capacity, allocate `required_box_capacity`, then call again. An undersized
buffer returns `LW_STATUS_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` without copying partial boxes.

```c
lw_detector* detector = NULL;
lw_detector_info info;
lw_detection_result result;
lw_detection_box* boxes;
lw_error error;

lw_error_init(&error);
if (lw_detector_create("det.lwm", NULL, &detector, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
    lw_detector_info_init(&info);
    lw_detector_get_info(detector, &info);
    boxes = (lw_detection_box*)calloc(info.max_candidates, sizeof(*boxes));
    lw_detection_result_init(&result);
    if (boxes != NULL && lw_detector_detect_bgr_u8(
            detector, bgr, bgr_byte_count, width, height, stride,
            boxes, info.max_candidates, &result, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
        /* boxes[0..result.box_count) are in original-image coordinates. */
    }
    free(boxes);
}
lw_detector_free(detector);
```

The postprocessor is a dependency-free, pure-C DB-style implementation. It
does not promise bit-identical boxes to OpenCV contours or Clipper offsets; its
precise implementation and correctness boundary are documented in
`det-pipeline.md`.

## Public full OCR

`lw_ocr_create` composes a DET model, an optional CLS model, a REC model, and a
UTF-8 dictionary. Initialized options enable direction classification, use a
classifier threshold of `0.9`, limit one perspective crop to 16,000,000 pixels,
and embed the normal DET/CLS/REC option structures. Native 64-bit builds use
the online logical-processor count capped at eight independent CLS/REC workers
after DET; x86 and WebAssembly use one. Set `worker_count` in `1..16` to
override that policy. Initialize the outer and nested structures with
`lw_ocr_options_init`; remaining reserved fields must stay zero.

`worker_count` does not control DET operator parallelism. On native 64-bit
builds the runtime detects the process CPU budget once when the OCR handle is
created and gives DET a separate persistent intra-op pool, capped at eight
physical cores. Large eligible Conv nodes choose an active subset of that pool;
x86 and WebAssembly remain serial. This policy is internal and does not change
the public structure layout or ABI.

Set `use_direction_classification` to zero to omit CLS. In that mode the CLS
model path may be null, classification fields are zero, and no 180-degree
correction is applied. Otherwise, an odd classifier label whose score is
strictly greater than `classifier_threshold` rotates the private crop by 180
degrees before recognition. Tall crops are first rotated 90 degrees clockwise
by the perspective-crop stage.

`lw_ocr_run_bgr_u8` accepts decoded interleaved BGR8 pixels, not JPEG/PNG file
bytes. Results use two caller-owned buffers:

- `lw_ocr_line[]` stores one canonical clockwise quadrilateral plus DET, CLS,
  REC, rotation, and emitted-character metadata;
- one UTF-8 byte buffer stores all NUL-terminated strings. Each line selects its
  string with `text_offset` and `text_length`; length excludes the trailing NUL.

For a one-pass call, use `lw_ocr_get_info` and allocate `max_line_capacity` lines
and `max_text_capacity` bytes. To allocate exact output, pass null line/text
pointers with both capacities zero; the entire pipeline still runs and returns
`required_line_capacity` and `required_text_capacity`, so obtaining the output
requires a second call. If either supplied capacity is insufficient, the call
returns `LW_STATUS_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` and copies neither output buffer.

`detected_count` reports detector output. `line_count` can be smaller when a
degenerate quadrilateral cannot produce a valid crop. Output lines retain the
detector reading order. A crop exceeding `max_crop_pixels` returns
`LW_STATUS_MEMORY_LIMIT`.

### Full OCR quality profile

`lw_ocr_options_init` uses `960` as the public `recognizer.target_width` default
so ordinary full-page and long-text callers retain enough horizontal detail.
In composed OCR, the runtime selects an appropriate width from
`192/320/480/640/960` up to that maximum. Applications that need a faster,
lower-memory profile may explicitly set `options.recognizer.target_width = 320`.
The official benchmark commands pass their historical width explicitly when
reproducing the published 320-pixel baseline.

```c
lw_ocr* ocr = NULL;
lw_ocr_info info;
lw_ocr_result result;
lw_ocr_line* lines = NULL;
char* text = NULL;
lw_error error;

lw_error_init(&error);
if (lw_ocr_create("det.lwm", "cls.lwm", "rec.lwm", "ppocr_keys.txt",
                  NULL, &ocr, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
    lw_ocr_info_init(&info);
    if (lw_ocr_get_info(ocr, &info) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
        lines = (lw_ocr_line*)calloc(info.max_line_capacity, sizeof(*lines));
        text = (char*)malloc((size_t)info.max_text_capacity);
    }
    lw_ocr_result_init(&result);
    if (lines != NULL && text != NULL && lw_ocr_run_bgr_u8(
            ocr, bgr, bgr_byte_count, width, height, stride,
            lines, info.max_line_capacity, text, info.max_text_capacity,
            &result, &error) == LW_STATUS_OK) {
        /* text + lines[i].text_offset is NUL-terminated UTF-8. */
    }
}
free(text);
free(lines);
lw_ocr_free(ocr);
```

The complete crop geometry, reference tolerance, and real-image Golden gate are
documented in `full-ocr.md`.

## Errors

Programs should branch on `lw_status`, not parse diagnostic text. Relevant
planning errors are:

- `LW_STATUS_INVALID_ARGUMENT`: null pointer, wrong count, or bad options ABI;
- `LW_STATUS_INVALID_SHAPE`: incompatible dtype/rank/dimension/operator shape;
- `LW_STATUS_MEMORY_LIMIT`: tensor/workspace limit or size overflow;
- `LW_STATUS_OUT_OF_MEMORY`: host allocation failure;
- model load errors defined by the LWM loader.

Recognition, classification, detection, and full OCR additionally return
`LW_STATUS_INVALID_SHAPE` for a truncated BGR layout and
`LW_STATUS_MEMORY_LIMIT` when decoded dimensions exceed `max_image_pixels`.
Recognition, detection, and full OCR return `LW_STATUS_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` for
insufficient caller-owned output capacity.
