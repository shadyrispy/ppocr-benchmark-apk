# Tiny Legacy Web distribution

lw.PPOCR.C provides a separate compatibility build for older Chromium and
Android WebView environments. It is intentionally independent from the normal
Modern Web build.

| Distribution | Model | WASM | PDF | Baseline |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ocr-demo.html | PP-OCRv6 Tiny/optional variants | SIMD128 by default | Yes | Modern browsers |
| ocr-demo-legacy.html | PP-OCRv6 Tiny | Scalar WASM | No | Chrome/Chromium WebView 70+ |

Legacy is a compatibility build, not a performance build. It does not change
the C ABI, model format, Modern Web artifact, Node package, Small/Medium
variants, or PDF support.

## Build locally or in CI

The build requires Node.js 20+, the locked JavaScript tools, and the same pinned Emscripten release as the normal Web build:

~~~bash
cd web
npm ci
cd ..

emcmake cmake -S . -B build-wasm-legacy -G Ninja   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release   -DLW_BUILD_HTTP_DEMO=OFF   -DLW_BUILD_CSHARP_DEMOS=OFF   -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF   -DLW_WEB_LEGACY=ON   -DLW_WASM_SIMD128=OFF   -DLW_WEB_PDF=OFF   -DLW_BUILD_WEB_MODEL_VARIANTS=OFF

cmake --build build-wasm-legacy --target lw-ocr-js lw-ocr-html --parallel
~~~

The output names are deliberately distinct:

~~~text
build-wasm-legacy/lw_ppocr_web.js                 # raw Runtime (debug only)
build-wasm-legacy/lw_ppocr_web.legacy.js         # Chrome 70 Runtime (debug only)
build-wasm-legacy/legacy-runtime-report.json
build-wasm-legacy/lw-ppocr-legacy.js
build-wasm-legacy/ocr-demo-legacy.html
~~~

LW_WEB_LEGACY=ON fails configuration if SIMD, PDF, or Web model variants are
also enabled. The Legacy link uses MIN_CHROME_VERSION=70 and enables the
web, webview, and worker Emscripten environments. LEGACY_VM_SUPPORT is not
used because it disables WebAssembly.

## Runtime metadata and diagnostics

The SDK exposes:

~~~javascript
LwPpocr.buildInfo
// {
//   flavor: "legacy",
//   wasmSimd128: false,
//   pdf: false,
//   minChromeVersion: 70,
//   jsTarget: "chrome70"
// }
~~~

The standalone page labels itself as the compatibility build. If JavaScript
or WASM initialization fails, the page displays a copyable diagnostics panel
containing the build flavor, user agent, capabilities, bootstrap state, and
last error. It never includes image bytes, OCR text, or local file paths.

Legacy supports image OCR only. PDF controls are not included in this
distribution. CI runs both paired builds with explicit `useCls: true`, matching
the option used to define the shared Tiny Web golden. The scalar Legacy result
must be deterministic across two runs, retain all 16 lines and the expected first
line, and exactly match the Golden text SHA-256. Per-line and character differences
remain in the report for diagnosis, but do not weaken the correctness gate.

The Legacy SDK runtime is lowered with the pinned esbuild toolchain before packaging. CI parses the complete SDK and every inline script in the final HTML with the Chrome 70 syntax gate. The gate accepts the BigInt grammar already supported by Chrome 70, while rejecting optional chaining, nullish coalescing, class fields, and other newer syntax; the older Python test checks packaging metadata. The raw and lowered runtime files are debug-only artifacts and are not part of the customer download.

The CI workflow builds and tests this artifact in an independent legacy job
and uploads it as lw.PPOCR.C-browser-legacy-<commit>. It is upload-only for
now; Release workflow publication waits for physical validation on the target
realme Q2/older WebView device.
