# PP-OCRv6 Runtime Model Packs

`v0.2.0-preview.1` introduces a model-pack boundary without creating a separate Runtime binary for every model. A pack contains the converted LWM assets required by one PP-OCRv6 variant and a manifest that identifies the exact asset set.

The pack layout is self-contained and namespaced by variant:

```text
ppocrv6-small/
  manifest.json
  SHA256SUMS
  det.lwm
  cls.lwm
  rec.lwm
  ppocr_keys.txt
```

The manifest and checksum paths inside the pack are relative to that variant directory. Extracting Tiny, Small and Medium packs into one `models` directory therefore creates `models/ppocrv6-tiny`, `models/ppocrv6-small` and `models/ppocrv6-medium` without overwriting assets.

`asset_set_id` is derived from the variant, runtime revision and all four asset hashes. Applications can use it as a cache-directory revision, so a model upgrade cannot silently reuse an older set of files.

The packager consumes the exact converted directory that was tested by CI:

```powershell
python tools/prepare_ppocrv6_runtime_variant.py `
  --variant small `
  --build-dir build `
  --output-dir build/runtime-models/ppocrv6-small

python tools/package_ppocrv6_runtime.py `
  --input-dir build/runtime-models/ppocrv6-small `
  --variant small `
  --output dist/lw-ppocr-model-ppocrv6-small-0.2.0-preview.1.zip

python tools/validate_runtime_model_pack.py `
  dist/lw-ppocr-model-ppocrv6-small-0.2.0-preview.1.zip
```

The input directory must contain `det.lwm`, `cls.lwm`, `rec.lwm` and `ppocr_keys.txt`. Use `tools/prepare_ppocrv6_runtime_variant.py` to produce the canonical directory from a native build before packaging. The same command works for `tiny`, `small` and `medium`. The ZIP is deterministic and stored without compression so its checksum is stable across CI runners.
The validator also rejects path traversal, duplicate members, mixed variant roots,
missing assets, checksum drift, and extra files before any model is accepted.
The Tiny, Small and Medium CI validation jobs upload a machine-readable
`summary.json` together with `pack-validation.json`. The summary records the
normalized `runtime_version`, `runtime_status`, `asset_set_id`, and
`manifest_sha256` returned by the pack validator, in addition to the OCR golden
checksum. This lets a release audit prove that the uploaded model pack was
validated against the same runtime revision and exact manifest, rather than
only checking that a ZIP file exists.

Manifest version fields are part of the pack contract:

- `model_revision` must use `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with an optional prerelease suffix. A leading `v` is accepted by the packager and normalized away.
- `runtime_status` is derived from `model_revision`: revisions containing `-` are `preview`; stable revisions are `production`.
- `minimum_runtime_version` is an independent compatibility floor and defaults to `0.2.0`.
- `lwm_format_version` uses the `major.minor` form.
- `recommended.rec.adaptive_width` and `recommended.rec.max_width` describe the tested REC policy.

For a production revision, pass an explicit minimum runtime when needed:

```powershell
python tools/prepare_ppocrv6_runtime_variant.py `
  --variant tiny `
  --build-dir build `
  --output-dir build/runtime-models/ppocrv6-tiny

python tools/package_ppocrv6_runtime.py `
  --input-dir build/runtime-models/ppocrv6-tiny `
  --variant tiny `
  --runtime-version 0.2.0 `
  --minimum-runtime-version 0.2.0 `
  --output dist/lw-ppocr-model-ppocrv6-tiny-0.2.0.zip
```

Tiny remains the default model in the C/HTTP, Web, Android, Desktop Java and Node/WASM packages. Small and Medium are opt-in preview assets and do not replace those defaults. On a tagged release, the workflow publishes `lw.PPOCR.C-<version>-ppocrv6-tiny-runtime.zip`, `lw.PPOCR.C-<version>-ppocrv6-small-runtime.zip` and `lw.PPOCR.C-<version>-ppocrv6-medium-runtime.zip` only after the Windows and Linux validation packs have identical SHA-256 values.

The same tagged release also publishes separately named Small and Medium browser SDK/HTML files. Those browser artifacts pass variant-specific full-text golden OCR and engine lifecycle tests before publication. They are self-contained model distributions; do not combine an SDK file from one variant with the filename or expectations of another. PDF regression and the default mobile-browser recommendation remain Tiny-only.
