# Scalar kernel milestone

This milestone introduces the first executable FP32 building blocks for the
exact converted PP-OCRv6 tiny REC graph. The functions are private runtime
interfaces; they are not part of the public C ABI yet.

DET adds independently reference-tested `Concat`, `ConvTranspose`, `MaxPool`,
nearest/asymmetric/floor `Resize`, and `Sigmoid` kernels. These are deliberately
limited to the exact converted DET graph contract rather than general ONNX
operator coverage.

The binary kernels validate the expected output shape against NumPy/ONNX-style
broadcast rules and reject an output buffer that aliases either input. The
activation kernels and Softmax support in-place operation. Tensor rank is
limited to `LW_MAX_DIMS` (8), and all element-count and FP32 byte-size products
are checked before pointer indexing, including 32-bit builds.

After shape validation, same-shaped contiguous binary inputs and a contiguous
left input with a scalar right input dispatch to isolated AVX2 or SSE2 loops,
with the portable scalar loop as fallback. These paths cover Add, Mul, and Div,
process eight or four values per instruction, and retain scalar tails. Other
broadcasts with exactly one non-unit right dimension are split into contiguous
blocks: channel-style layouts reuse the right-scalar SIMD loop, while a matched
trailing dimension reuses the contiguous-pair SIMD loop. CPU capability is
detected once before all blocks. Broadcasts with multiple non-unit right
dimensions continue through the general rank-aligned coordinate implementation.
A ten-value direct test exercises every operation, vector body, and tail and
requires scalar, SSE2, AVX2, and automatic-dispatch output to be byte-identical
before NumPy comparison. Additional NumPy cases cover both single-axis block
modes and the retained general-broadcast fallback.

Seven Depthwise Conv nodes with 3x3 kernels, unit stride/dilation, symmetric
pad 1, and one output channel per group dispatch across output width to isolated
AVX2 or SSE2 kernels. Each lane starts from the channel bias and visits the same
valid kernel positions in the same order as the portable scalar specialization;
the only difference is that eight or four independent output positions advance
together. Border positions and non-vector-aligned row tails remain scalar. The
Medium DET regular 7x1/1x7 and 5x1/1x5 shapes also have an AVX2 path with the
same multiply-then-add contract. All other Depthwise, grouped, dilated, or
asymmetric shapes retain the general Conv implementation.

Regular Medium DET 5x5/pad-2 and 7x7/pad-3 Conv additionally use AVX2
four-output register-tile paths when the output channel count is divisible by
four. They keep the same border/tail semantics, store each eight-column tile
once, and fall back to the existing path for other shapes and non-AVX2 targets.

## Correctness tests

`kernel-reference-driver` emits deterministic results for representative
three-dimensional broadcasts, activations, and a Softmax input containing
values near `+1000` and `-1000`. `tensor-reference-driver` covers layout
changes, multi-axis reduction, padded AveragePool, and batched MatMul.
`conv-reference-driver` covers normal, grouped, Depthwise, asymmetric dilated
Conv, ConvTranspose, and in-place BatchNormalization. The Conv/BN expectations come from ONNX's
opset-11 ReferenceEvaluator; the other Python tests use NumPy. Every output is
checked with an FP32 tolerance. The native drivers also check invalid shapes,
duplicate or invalid axes, forbidden aliases, null inputs, non-finite
parameters, and 32-bit buffer-size overflow.

The same test suite is built and passes locally for Windows x64 and Windows x86.
Linux remains covered by the repository CI definition but is not claimed as
verified until that workflow runs remotely.

## Deliberate boundary

The public recognizer API now wraps the private executor, preprocessing, and
CTC decoder without exposing kernel or tensor internals. The executor dispatches
all 159 converted REC nodes, binds constants/workspace, and passes
complete-output comparison. The optimized MatMul contract deliberately
matches the released REC graph: one or more input matrices multiplied by one
shared two-dimensional weight matrix. A portable general MatMul fallback now
also accepts rank-N inputs on both sides with ONNX-style broadcast batch
dimensions; it is reference-tested and is currently used only by the
analysis-only PP-OCRv6 Small prototype.
Its cache-contiguous implementation initializes four output rows at a time,
then scans each shared weight row contiguously across columns. This reuses the
weight row across the block while preserving the inner-dimension accumulation
order for every output element. It adds no allocation or threads.

The executor dispatches this MatMul contract through isolated AVX2 and SSE2
kernels on x86/x64 CPUs. The canonical AVX2 and SSE2 loops process eight and
four independent columns per instruction respectively and use the same scalar
tail. AVX2 selection requires the CPUID AVX/OSXSAVE bits, XGETBV confirmation
that the operating system saves XMM/YMM state, and the CPUID AVX2 bit. x64
selects SSE2 as its minimum SIMD level; x86 validates SSE2 with CPUID; non-x86
and unsupported x86 CPUs retain the scalar implementation.

For an x64 AVX2 MatMul with a constant B matrix, at least four rows, K at least
64, N at least 1024, and a row count divisible by four, session construction
packs B once into `[ceil(N/16)][K][16]`. The execution kernel accumulates four
rows and 16 columns together. Padding exists only in the private session cache;
the canonical LWM payload remains unchanged. Other targets and shapes allocate
no MatMul cache and use the canonical path. Both kernels use separate multiply
and add instructions rather than FMA, preserving inner-dimension accumulation
order. A partial-panel direct test requires canonical, scalar-packed, and AVX2
packed output to be byte-identical before the graph, pipeline, and Golden-corpus
tests run.

The Conv implementation is a direct scalar loop with no im2col allocation. A
single grouped implementation covers the model's normal, grouped, and
Depthwise configurations, including its 1x5 Depthwise layer. Its first
profile-directed optimization hoists valid kernel bounds and reuses
row/channel pointers while preserving FP32 accumulation order; it still uses
no explicit SIMD or threads. A second portable-C fast path traverses the
spatial plane contiguously for 1x1, unit-stride, unit-dilation, zero-padding
Conv, including batched and grouped inputs, while retaining the input-channel
accumulation order. That pointwise path now dispatches to isolated AVX2 or SSE2
spatial loops when supported and otherwise retains the portable scalar loop.
The vector paths process eight or four spatial elements per instruction, use
separate multiply and add operations rather than FMA, and preserve the
input-channel accumulation order for each output element. A third cache-local
path covers ordinary 3x3, stride-2, unit-dilation, pad-1 Conv and keeps the same
addition order. It dispatches to AVX2 or SSE2 kernels that deinterleave
contiguous input loads into eight or four independent output positions. Bounds
checks prevent vector loads from crossing a row; borders and tails stay scalar.
These paths add no allocation or threads. Direct tests exercise AVX2/SSE2
vector bodies, scalar boundaries, and tails;
the direct SIMD and automatic-dispatch results must be byte-identical to the
portable implementation before comparison with ONNX. The test-only executor
profiler is private, reports Conv and MatMul node shapes, and is not part of the
installed API or packages. See
[`kernel-optimization.md`](kernel-optimization.md) for the measured A/B result.
